The Deed Shop is north of the Adventurer's Guild in Silvermere.
Use the deed to get the number of keys and emblems you will need for
your gang. Emblems are loyal, keys however are not, supposedly keys will be
deleted from non gang members inventory at cleanup *untested* but they
wont be removed from any vault *tested*  Emblems must in inventory at all times in the gang house or the guardians will
attack you. MegaMUD Users should make sure their gang's guardians are set to
friendly for all there chars in the gang. If a guardian is accidentally attacked they
will continue attacking on sight until cleanup. It's also a good idea to
change your emblem to auto-equip since it is loyal. Only the <u>owner</u> of the gang house can STOCK, UNSTOCK and MARKUP items in
the gang house shop. The nightly tax comes out of the gang leader's Silvermere bank account.
If insufficient funds are in the bank account the house will be repossessed along with all items in it. 
<P>
<b>Requirements:</b> 10 Million experience in order for a gang to purchase a gang house.<p>
<font size="2"><b>Notes:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>GangShops can only stock a max of 10 unique items and a max of 20 duplicate items.<br>
<li>All Ganghouses have a Rubbish Room for disposal of items. esp those extra ornate keys (vault keys) you end up with<br>
<li>All Guardians have these stats: 2000 Exp, 350 hps, 50/3 AC, 65 MR, See Hidden, Chaotic Evil.<br>
