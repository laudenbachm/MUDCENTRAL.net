<center>+        Version 1.11c - 04/28/2000       +</center>

1)  Ganghouses! Introduced ten ganghouses scattered across the realm. All
    have user-customizable room and item descriptions. Locations to
    Ganghouses are described in ganghouse "Deeds".
2)  New "Deed" items, sold in the Deed Shop, purchasable only by the gang
    leader with gang experience requirements set by the Sysop. Deeds handle
    distribution of ganghouse keys and emblems, also the deed holder is the
    only person who can control the ganghouse shop.
3)  New guardian monsters for ganghouses, these monsters guard the
    ganghouses from non gang-members. Emblems are required by gang members
    to signify they belong to that gang. WARNING: IF YOU ATTACK THE
    GUARDIANS WITH AN EMBLEM THEY WILL CONTINUE TO ATTACK UNTIL CLEANUP.

    a text file specified in the default file descriptions. You must create
    the new description in a text file and give to your Sysop.
11) Set certain spells to remove spells of like ability as they are not
    stackable. These changes were done to discourage use of the "10 spell"
    bug.

    user feedback.
13) Lowered magic resistance of certain items, as per extensive user
    feedback.
