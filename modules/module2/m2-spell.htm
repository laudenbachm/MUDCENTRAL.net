<p>NEW SPELL (from crumbling bible dropped by the night hag), undoes the effects of 

being turned into stone by the huge basilisk. Stone lasts for 10 rounds or so and 

since you're stoned, you can't move, talk, cast etc, it's nasty!

<p>the beholder drops a black tome that contains the following spells:



<p>mana flux - randomly rgens mana - your normal rate changes into 1-50+/tick

<p>chaos shield - adds/subtracts 10 AC randomly



<p>As a sidenote, a tome in the library near the beholder reads:



<p>This large, heavy tome lays open, a thin red silk bookmark nestled between its

pages. The ancient, yellow pages are covered in a thin, spidery text which

reads:



<p>"King Yeshuz is mad.  I stand here writing what may be my last testament to

 the horrible crimes being commited outside, in hopes that anyone finding this

 may learn from the deadly curse our mad king has brought upon us.  Our King

 was not always an evil man, and never a madman, but ever had a lust for power

 and glory.  A warrior-king he was, proud and mighty, worthy in battle and just

 in rule.  In the end, however, his greed overcame him, and as his victories in

 battle increased, his happiness waned.  He began to consult with untrustworthy

 wizards, but for a long while he was unable to find what he sought.  Failure

 after failure left many wizard heads impaled on the gates to the Royal Palace.

 Finally, to our dismay and doom, the necromancer Zorastra came, and her beauty

 and power awed Yeshuz.  Together they probed the secrets of life and death,

 searching for that which the King forever sought-- immortality.



<p> It is not known whether or not Zorastra intentionally betrayed Yeshuz.  One

 night, she and King Yeshuz went to the museum in the centre of the city, the

 only place where the spell of great power could be cast-- Zorastra planned to

 drain the energy of the entire city to power a portal to the outer planes, and

 this necessitated a central location.  Once there, the Necromancer queen began

 her dread spell, and the entire city bend under her magical yoke.  With a

 blinding flash of light, a dark portal snapped into being, and the demon lord

 Goru-Nezar stepped out.  Little did they realize what a scourge they had let

 free into our world!  Zorastra, overconfident in her power, commanded the

 demon lord to reveal to them the secrets of undying existance.  With a

 horrible sneer, he granted her wish.  Raising his hand, he pointed at her, and

 a dark beam speared forth.  King Yeshuz watched in horror as Zorastra's body

 began to decompose, completely rotting away within a few moments!  Goru-Nezar

 then trapped hey soul in the undead form of a shadowraith, thus fulfilling her

 with for immortality-- if not in the manner she expected.  Yeshuz, horrified

 beyond all explanation, turned to flee, but the great demon lord grasped him

 with his ungodly strength and hurled him screaming through the dark portal.



<p> All this time, I had been aware of these happenings, and watched with dismay

 through my scrying orb.  Now Goru-Nezar noticed me, looked straight at me

 through the orb, and laughed.  With a flick of his hand, my crystal ball

 shattered, and I was left bleeding from many cuts.  This was two days ago.

 Since then, the demon lord has been widening the portal, increasing its power

 so as to allow his unholy horde of demonic warriors to pour forth and ravage

 the city.  I know they will not stop there, like a plague they will scour the

 land, destroying all trace of life and goodness they encounter.  Already much

 of the city has been destroyed by the ravenous demons, and only a handful have

 entered through that accursed portal.



<p> My time here is waning.  It is only a matter of time before the demons find

 this concealed chamber and destroy me.  I have tranported the holy master of

 the temple to me, and together we will attempt to attract the mercy of the

 gods.  We stand together in a circle of protection of my fabrication, so for

 a short time we are safe.  Our prayer will be for the gods to blast this city

 into nothingness-- anything less may mean the escape of these unholy horrors,

 and in a few short hours no-one will be left.  These few words will be my

 last, as it is now time to begin our lengthy prayer.  May the gods have mercy

 on our souls."
