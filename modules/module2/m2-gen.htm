<p>This module is definitely made for L25+ characters.  Many of the monsters are 800-1500 

exp apiece and some are extremely difficult, so be prepared. Bring magical weapons, good 

spellcasters including as many L30+ mage class guys as possible. Tons of bosses! woo hoo!



<p><font color=#ffcc33 size=4>Here are some of the new places you'll find:</font>
<ul>
<li>Silver River

<li>Mossy Cave

<li>Ironwood Forest

<li>Brozewood Forest

<li>Copperwood Forest

<li>Silverwood Forest - New shop!

<li>Dying Grove

<li>Filthy Encampment

<li>Ancient Ruins - Lots of bosses and secrets!

<li>Black Wastelands - Tough!
</ul>


<p>Mystics (with DH bracers) and Mage-classes (L30+) have really been beefed up in this patch.



<p>Supposedly, the race and class changes are in the module but according to WCC implementing 

them requires a reset of the game. This is still unverified.



<p>There is now a signpost in the town square pointing to the nearby shops.



<p>There is a practice dummy in the small arena that doesn't attack back -- great for testing 

weapons/attacks on. Downside is no sneaking or hiding inside the arena. The dummy CAN be

killed, although it takes some serious damage to do it.



<p>The island is different. You can buy a wooden skiff from the boatman at the docks, it is 

30 gold, and lets you into the silver river, n to the island and lab, w to the forests

and ruins, e to the mossy cave. Another new area can be accessed from the ancient ruins 

through a whirling vortex - the monsters there are deadly!



<p>The Dragon Carving is a statue in a room and you have to insert the various fangs into 

it in the right order to go fight a boss or open up a new area or something. It will 

eat all your fangs and start you over if you insert one in the wrong order. You get the 

fangs from the serpents of the corresponding color.



<p>There is a passage from the silver river to the dragon teeth hills.



<p>ATTENTION SNEAKERS! The infamous sneak-check (do an action to yourself after typing 

sneak to see if you are sneaking or not) no longer works in module 2, or maybe it is 

1.1j that does this, but one of the two delivers this horrible blow to sneakers of the 

earth.



<p>Mystics lose the ability to gain the "free" rip from the golden sickle and "drain" from 

the curved black dagger during punch, kick and jumpkick, and they can no longer use a 

main gauche. But the demonhide bracers make them a powerful class indeed!



<p><font color=#ffcc33 size=4>Monsters:</font>



<p>All the monsters in the dragon area have been beefed up and are much nastier now 

as well as being better EXP. Many of the module 1 monsters have also gone up in

exp.  Refer to the exp charts elsewhere on my page for specific updates as I get them.



<p><font color=#ffcc33 size=4>Spells:</font>


<p>Many of the spells went down in mana - will fill in the details soon...



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>Mages</font>


<p>shld - Ethereal shield is now +12/0 ac

<p>dfir - now 16 mana, possibly no cap for max damage (my L44 mage did 230)



<p>Try casting isto on a monster then use a fire-based spell on them and watch your

damage skyrocket! This trick only works on specific monsters - if you find out 

which ones let me know (I know it works well in the lava fields)



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>Druid</font>


<p>enta - Entangle now Druid-3, L15

<p>blaz - Blaze now Druid-3

<p>free - Freedom Level 16 now

<p>skin - Barkskin costs 15 mana now



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>Priests</font>


<p>Priest-1 lost cure disease



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>Bards  </font>


<p>valr, trav, mfor are all party spells now.



<p><font color=#ffcc33 size=4>Items:</font>



<p>adamantite bracers - downgraded to 250 enc now (was 150 enc)

<p>serpent armbands - downgraded to 125 enc now (was 75 enc)

<p>starsteel greatsword - Low of 8 (was 10) - now hits 8-29 and possibly L20 restricted

<p>blacksteel scimitar - turns into a sunsword - hits 8-27 + possible 6-30 scorch

<p>red enameled scalemail - much lower reduction of fire-based damage than before



<p>black leather tunic, ruby necklace, skull sword, bone-handled headcutter, golden 

broadsword, golden sickle, starsteel greatsword, heavy bone mace cannot be sold anywhere!



<p>Most of the new items can only be sold in the junkyard!



<p>The dragon carving and frozen hydra and frozen giant CAN be moved!
