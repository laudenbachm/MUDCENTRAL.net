<tr><td><b>A wide platform encircles the tree here, providing a floor for the common
room. Stairs descend through a hole by the trunk, and a large fire, carefully
tended, burns in a stove at one end. Many tables and chairs litter this vast
platform. At the opposite end to the fire, a small stage has been set up.

of certain things. ie: temple & junkyard (see below) to the west,
island and shops north, curio shop and forest east, etc.

<tr><td><b>This dirty, rectangular plot is filled with all manner of
heavy, useless objects, such as smashed statues, ruined carts,
mangled furniture, and corroded armour. In the 
centre of the
lot stands a strange, gleaming metal contraption, emblazoned
with the High Guild of Magery's seal. A plaque on the opposite
side to the seal apparently details instructions on its use.
The junkyard continues to the east, and exits onto Temple street
to the south.
<br>Obvious exits: south, east
