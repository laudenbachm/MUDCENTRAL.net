<p><font color=#008800 size=4>ancient willow - 10000 exp</font>

<p>This massive and ancient willow tree is rife with a black rot. Despite

this malady it appears powerful and strong, and is possibly the oldest tree

you have ever seen. A haunting melody seems to emanate from it, drawing you

irresistably closer.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>behemoth - 15000 exp</font>

<p>This massive creature towers above you like a living hill. Its four short,

powerful legs propel its huge body about with surprising speed. Thick, sharp

tusk-like teeth jut out of its cavernous maw, easily wide enough to swallow

someone whole. 



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>bloodbear - 1100 exp</font>

<p>The deadly bloodbear is named for its ability to sense strife and

aggression, which enrages and attracts it. When it feels these emotions

nearby, it enters a berserker rage, and races to where the sensations are

coming from to slay indescriminately.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>chimera - 17000 exp</font>

<p>This ugly beast has the hindquarters of a huge goat, and the fore- quarters of

a lion. Its body has black wings like those of a dragon. The chimera has three

heads, one of a goat, one of a lion, and one of an orange-scaled dragon. They

are known to be voracious in appetite.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>dragonfish - 900 exp</font>

<p>The dragonfish is widely known as one of the most vicious freshwater

predators. Though it is not huge, its razor-sharp teeth, incredible speed,

and burning steam breath make it a terrible foe. Dragonfish are thought

to be the result of a mad wizard's exp</font>eriments.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>frozen giant</font>

<p>This twenty-foot-tall giant is encased in a living tomb of ice three feet

thick. His massively muscled arms are frozen reaching out as if grasping at

something, his face fixed in an outraged frown. 



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>frozen hydra - 24000 exp</font>

<p>This huge, seven-headed beast is covered in a three-foot thick prison of ice,

its snarling visage forever frozen. It appears heavily armoured and armed, its

teeth being long and swordlike, its necks long and agile. Gripped in one of its

mouths is a large, glittering icy hammer, maul-sized for someone of human

stature. 



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>ghost - 1500 exp</font>

<p>This nearly transparent apparition moans softly as it floats about. It

clutches its torn white funeral rags closely to itself. Although it appears

sad and lonely, the undead are known to vent their rage and frustration upon

the living.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>grizzly bear - 1000 exp</font>

<p>This large, generally peaceful animal can nonetheless be a deadly foe

when aroused. Its incredible strength, good speed, and sharp claws can down

many adventurers before they have the opportunity to strike back. If left

alone, they tend to ignore people.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>hobgoblin - 650 exp</font>

<p>This tall, brutish figure is unmistakeably a hobgoblin. Its cruel eyes glare

out at you evilly from its helm, and it hefts its heavy flail with malice.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>huge basilisk - 7000 exp</font>

<p>This massive beast is nearly fifteen feet in length, and ressembles a

brown-black giant lizard. Its eight short legs are thick and strong and its

toothy maw filled with razor-sharp fangs. It hangs its heavy head, and its

large lidded eyes seem to be staring at the ground.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>huoron - 1500 exp</font>

<p>The huorns are the semi-intelligent trees of the forest. They are not

truly sentient, but obey the commands of the intelligent trees. All huorns

are tough and slow, but can make formidable opponents.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>imp - 900 exp</font>

<p>This hideous little creature flies around on reddish bat wings. It leers

at you evilly with its grotesque demon face, and flicks its scorpion tail at

you. Imps are known to be quite evil, and while not as powerful as some

demons, still dangerous to the unwary.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>killer bee - 1300 exp</font>

<p>This insectile monstrosity is fully as large as a man, and many times

faster. Its huge stinger could easily gut someone, even without its deadly

poison. Killer Bees are known to attack unprovoked, and although not truly

evil, they are as close to it as can be.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>lamia - 725 exp</font>

<p>This horrific creature appears to be half serpent, half woman. Her

snakelike lower body is long and muscular, and her upper body is that of a

beautiful, evil woman. In one hand she wields a wavy-bladed dagger, and with

the other makes arcane gestures.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>leprechaun - 825 exp</font>

<p>This interesting-looking fellow is clad in green clothes and wears a

pair of sturdy shoes. His bright red beard and hair are somewhat spiky and

coarse. In one hand he wields a gilded club, and in the other holds a long

smoking pipe.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>Lord of the Hunt - 30000 exp</font>

<p>This terryfing being stands at least fifteen feet tall, and is as lithe as a

cat. Garbed in a strange, metallic garb, he wields a long spear which sparkles

with blue light. The Lord of the Hunt's bright green eyes almost entrance you

as he stares right at you!



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>nexus hunter - 6000 exp</font>

<p>This tall, forbidding figure is garbed in a strange assortment of shimmering

multicoloured clothing, in contrast to its ebony skin. In one hand, it wields a

gleaming metal disc, and as it stalks though the wasteland you witness its

catlike grace.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>ogre grunt - 1000 exp</font>

<p>These brutish ogres are used for intimidation and as shock troops. Their

massive bulk and incredible strength, coupled with their nearly

inexhaustible fighting power, make them effective fighting machines despite

their clumsiness and extreme stupidity.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>ogre-mage - 1500 exp</font>

<p>The powerful ogre-mages are ogres who have been magically altered so

that their intelligence is increased, and so they gained magical powers.

They are cunning and intimidating foes who have no love for other races.

Their ruthlessness and bloodlust is legendary.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>pixie - 725 exp</font>

<p>This small, mischievious creature is one of the elusive faeries. It wears

curious, brightly coloured clothing and flutters around on its dragonfly-like

wings. Pixies are generally harmless but many command powerful magics, and

dislike being disturbed.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>planar storm - 8000 exp</font>

<p>This swirling cloud is a mix of dark grey, violet, and blue. It rolls through

the air with a crackling noise, arcs of brilliant energy continually spearing

out in all directions. Moving with a malevolent grace, it almost seems alive as

it seeks out the nearest life-form.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>prismatic dragon - 21000 exp</font>

<p>This glittering dragon has scales of a thousand hues, all of which reflect the

light in prismatic sprays. Shining chrome teeth and claws arm this deadly

beast, and the light of hatred in its eyes makes you pause in fear.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>quickling - 975 exp</font>

<p>This small, elf-like creature has pale grey skin and glowing red eyes.

Its four-foot-tall body is slender and appears frail, but it moves with

unearthly speed and agility. In its hand it wields a long, black, wavy-bladed

dagger.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>shadowraith - 1200 exp</font>

<p>This unnerving apparition seems to be your worst nightmare-- a large

shadowy figure with long, wicked claws and hellishly burning eyes. It moves

with an unnatural grace as it stalks you!



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>twisted one - 650 exp</font>

<p>This hideous mutation can only be the product of some form of magical

exp</font>erimentation, or the result of some curse of the gods. The twisted

one is a combination of beast and man, with great strength and a hunchbacked

body



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>unholy idol - 20000 exp</font>

<p>This huge, six-armed obsidian statue is crafted to appear as an unholy warrior

armoured in wickedly spiked plate and helm. In two of its hands it wields a

long barbed lance, blood-red in colour. Burning flame lights its eyes, and it

advances with uncanny precision! 



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>unicorn - 2000 exp</font>

<p>The beautiful unicorn is a magical protector of the woods. It is strong

and quick, and extremely skilled with its horn. Although normally shy and

reclusive, the unicorn is a relentless and deadly foe when it encounters

creatures of evil.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>war dog - 525 exp</font>

<p>This massively-muscled beast stands fully four feet tall at the

shoulder. It has a maw filled with curved, razor-sharp teeth, claws like

steel, and a rabid fury to match. Around its neck it wears a thick spiked

iron collar.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>water elemental - 900 exp</font>

<p>The water elemental is extremely difficult to notice, as it is only

barely visible in any body of water. It flows about rapidly, able to

change its shape and to deliver powerful blows with its watery limbs.

Elementals are also known to sometimes command elemental magics.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>woodelf druid - 1500 exp</font>

<p>This tall, mysterious figure is cloaked in a deep-green cape which

almost seems to blend into the background. The elf wields a long darkwood

staff, and strides around tending to the forest.

With a broad smile, the woodelf says, "Welcome to our forest, stranger.

These are hard times, and so I must be brief. You may find our village by

following these directions: go to the hill with the ruined tower in the

southwestern part of the copperwood forest. From the top of the hill, travel

south, southwest, northwest, and north. At that point, there will be a

concealed passage through the trees to the northwest-- simply walk straight

through."



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>woodelf lord - 18000 exp</font>

<p>This tall, well-built elf has a commanding air about him. Garbed in

shimmering silvery robes and wielding a shining silverwood staff, he is the

definition of regal. Although he appears stern, a hint of warmth and compassion

can be seen in his eyes.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>woodelf ranger - 1500 exp</font>

<p>This tall, mysterious figure is cloaked in a deep-green cape which

almost seems to blend into the background. The elf wields a long broad-bladed

war spear with skill, and stalks about the forest patrolling for evil

creatures.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>woodelf wardancer - 2000 exp</font>

<p>This athletic figure is garbed in nothing more than shimmering silks. She

twirls and dances with incredible speed, whirling her spear about in deadly

arcs. Wardancers are known to be excellent, agile warriors who often use

acrobatics in their attacks.



<p><font color=#008800 size=4>wraithlord - 16000 exp</font>

<p>This tall figure radiates an aura of horror, making your hair stand on end. It

is shrouded in an evil darkness which saps the courage from you. Its shadowy

form is difficult to see, but its slitted, glowing red eyes are readily

apparent.
