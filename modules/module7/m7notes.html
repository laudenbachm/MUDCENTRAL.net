<center><b><font size=6 color=#ffcc33>Module 7: Savage Lands</center></font>
<pre>
<center>+        Version 1.11b - 01/28/2000       +</center>

1)  Swamp trolls and two-headed troll are no longer "immortal" once they
    regen. This problem has now been resolved. Again, please report any
    problems with trolls you find.
2)  Critical hits formulas reworked. There should still be a limit on the
    bonus to crit from using a "quick and deadly" weapon, however percentage
    on normal critical hits should no longer be effected.
3)  Some misc. quest issues regarding Module 7 were repaired.
4)  Loyal items including new quest items now stay with the owner even
    if a hang up is detected during combat. Loyal items should stay with
    the owner in all cases.
5)  Fang for magma blast now placed on monster.
6)  Fixed doors that wouldn't open in various areas.
7)  Fixed alder chest.
8)  Fixed Shadowy Healer.
9)  Fixed crashing problem related to manriki-gusari.
10) Increased drop rate percentage on some quest related items.


<center>+        Version 1.11a - 12/30/1999       +</center>

1)  Fixed wrong message for platinum mace and other grammar corrections.
2)  Fixed some misc. room errors and other reported problems.
3)  Reports that trolls were impossible to kill, should now be fixed.
    Please report to us if this problem still exists. Also, please include
    the version of Worldgroup or MajorBBS you are running when reporting any
    errors to us, so that we may test on that platform.
4)  Changed release version scheme. 1.11a through 1.11z, then 1.12a through
    1.12z and so on.. will be the new order for minor changes, where a major
    release would skip to 1.2 and so forth.


<center>+        Version 1.1z - 12/28/1999        +</center>

1)  Fixed some quest problems that were missed in a final update.
2)  Grammar fixes that were pushed in at the same time as #1.


<center>+        Version 1.1y - 12/28/1999        +</center>
1)  Made some quest monsters stationary, where before they
    were moveable.
2)  Introduced new exit type "Spell Trap". This will allow
    for more imaginative traps in future modules, and will 
    help with guildhouses when they are introduced.
3)  Newest mystic powers not gainable by training. This 
    shouldn't be considered the standard for future mods.
4)  Upgraded values and/or durations for all spell groups. 
    Everyone try out your spells, you should be pleasantly 
    suprised.
5)  Changed bland spell descriptions of some spells (ex: 
    way of the monkey's description was DV.)
6)  Changed attack combat messages to reflect "old-style" 
    messages, this is in transition and currently permenant. 
    Please report any errors you find.
7)  Capped "quick and deadly" critical hit bonus. Before, 
    "Q and D" gave an unlimited bonus to criticals, now it 
    should only add 10% of natural critical hit %. (ex: 
    Natural crit% is 20, with QnD weapon: 22%. This does not
    effect mystic attacks (pu, ki, ju), this change is 
    transitional.
8)  Introduced ability to learn spells via NPC interaction. 
    This may be seen in later releases.
9)  Introduced a good-freindly area, (monsters attack evils, 
    don't attack good, and no eps taken.)
10) Changed class titles up to level 55. "Master" title is 
    now not currently achievable. Feedback is welcomed.
11) Boosted some limited items powers/abilities up to reflect
    the rarity of the item. (ie: Lim 1 items should, in most 
    cases, be better then Lim 3 items.) This includes quest 
    items.
12) Made first quest items require you be at least level 10 
    before you can use them, as you can't normally get them 
    until you are level 10.
13) Changed critical hits back to red from yellow by popular 
    demand.
14) Changed quest rings to become "loyal items". This should 
    fix quest rings "poofing" on death.
15) Added quest rings to be dropped by some new monsters so
    those that lost their rings can now replace.
16) Started fixing some pre-Module 7 message spelling and bug
    errors. Please report any still outstanding that are 
    discovered.
