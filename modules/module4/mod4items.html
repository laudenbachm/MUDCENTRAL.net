<tr><td><b>
<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Adamantite Chainmail</font>
<p>This heavy suit of chainmail armour gleams with the smooth darkness of the
metal known as adamantite. Nearly indestructible and quite rare, only master
smiths have the necessary skill to craft such works of art.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Bardic Lute</font>
<p>This rare lute is a remnant of the days of the legendary bards. Its resonance
is perfect, its contruction a mastery of woodcraft.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Black Steel Halberd</font>
<p>This massive, unwieldly weapon has a wickedly-curved head, and is fashioned
from a gleaming steel the colour of soot. Wound about its haft is a thin cord
which provides a good grip.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Climbing Harness</font>
<p>This heavy leather harness is complete with hooks and rope. It is used by
climbers to anchor themselves while climbing, and is invaluable when making the
treacherous climbs up mountains.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Copper Ore</font>
<p>This rough chunk of rock contains a large portion of copper. Somewhat valuable,
copper is used in many everyday applications. Before the copper can be
extracted from the ore, it must be smelted and the rock skimmed off the surface
of the metal.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Dwarven Axe</font>
<p>This heavy, one-handed axe is short-hafted and has a single blade shaped like a
half moon. Well-balanced and durable, it is a fine example of the fact that
daily dwarven handiwork greatly surpasses most works of masters of other races.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Dwarven Chainmail</font>
<p>This heavy suit of chainmail is a product of the masterful skill of the
dwarves. Made of two thin layers of tiny, but unbelievably strong rings, it
provides a level of protection seldom seen in light armours.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Dwarven Craft-Hammer</font>
<p>This heavy, two-handed hammer is imbued with powerful striking magics. It is
used by the elite dwarven smiths to craft the most precious of metals--
mithril. These hammers are the only things that have the power to craft
mithril, and consequently make incredible weapons in battle. However, they are
lacking greatly in accuracy.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Dwarven Hammer</font>
<p>This light hammer has a rectangular head of the finest dwarf-iron. It is easy
to swing yet hits hard, and would make an excellent weapon.
<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Room Ticket</font>
<p>This small ticket is good for a night's rest in an inn or tavern. Usually worth
the price, as resting in a comfortable inn bed is more beneficial than anywhere
else.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Fine Chainmail Tunic</font>
<p>This exquisite chainmail shirt is crafted from the finest high-steel.
Painstaking work has gone into its shining interlinked rings. It would provide
good protection from blows in combat.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Fine Greatsword</font>
<p>This heavy, two-handed sword has an extremely sharp four- foot blade that can
punch through even the heaviest armour with ease. It is made from high steel
and is commonly seen in the possession of high ranking officers.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Fine Mace</font>
<p>This sturdy weapon is crafted out of high-steel, and has been fashioned in such
a way that is is excellently balanced. This allows for heavier hitting with no
reduction in speed.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Fine Throwing Knife</font>
<p>This well-balanced, razor-sharp blade makes a formidable weapon at short range.
It is both accurate and damaging in the hands of an expert.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Gnomish Fish-Helm</font>
<p>This strangely-crafted device is made to ressemble a fish's head. Covering the
mouth and nose is an airtight wooden device that hooks up to a small pack of
sort on the back. It allows breathing of water, but only under extremely cold
conditions. Somewhat fragile, it is not useful in combat situations.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Golden Harp</font>
<p>This exquisite golden harp is crafted with intricate swirling patterns. Its
strings are fine and well-strung, and the melody that it plays when its strings
are plucked is heavenly.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Iron Crown</font>
<p>This light circlet is surprisingly finely-crafted, despite the fact it
is only iron. An eye-sized amber stone set in its front glitters brightly.
*Same AC as a Hard Leather Helm but -40 enc.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Iron Ore</font>
<p>This rough chunk of rock contains a large portion of iron. Useful in creating
weaponry and eveyrday items, it can be refined to make steel. Before being
usable, however, the iron must be extracted from the ore by smelting it.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Mine Pass</font>
<p>This small wooden card is etched with the symbol of the Miner's Guild of
Khazarad. Only people bearing this pass may enter the mines.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Moonstone</font>
<p>This small, semi-precious stone is semi-opaque, and is white with a pale blue
hue.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Ogre-Skin Shirt</font>
<p>This heavy shirt is made from the thick, boiled skin of an ogre. Known for
their toughness, Ogres are usually unwilling to part with their skin, but when
the occasion arises it makes excellent armour.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Pickaxe</font>
<p>This large tool has a heavy metal head, one side of which has a curved spike,
the other sporting a broad axe-like blade. It is indispensible to miners, who
use it to hack out the rock and then to break it up to expose the ore. It also
makes a good weapon.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Piece Of Jade</font>
<p>This small, fancy stone is a milky green in colour.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Runic Warhammer</font>
<p>This massive, heavy hammer's granite head is intricately carved with jagged
runes of a crude sort. The runes glow a fierce red and seem to pulsate to your
heartbeat. Its haft is of leather-bound ironwood, and appears well-worn.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Silver Flute</font>
<p>This beautiful silver flute sings with a clear, beautiful tone when played.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Silver Ore</font>
<p>This rough chunk of rock contains a large portion of silver. Fairly valuable,
it is mainly used in jewlery and high- quality dishware. The ore must be
smelted so that the silver can be extracted-- until then, it is nearly
worthless.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Swamp Boots</font>
<p>This is a pair of rigid leather boots, reinforced with iron caps on the toes.
They are solidly made, and provide good protection in combat.

<p><font size=4 color=#008800>Topaz Stone</font>
<p>This small, precious stone is a golden yellow in colour.
