ask the missions
<p>


The Grey Lord grows silent for a few moments, until finally his voice echoes
in your head. "We face a grave time before us Champion of Balance. The 
tangled
web this dark mage weaves has enveloped almost all of my agents into various
tasks. He truly knows our workings to well I fear." He lets out a long sigh 
of
frustration before continuing. "It would appear I once again depend upon you
to further our cause in this matter, nothing has been found out concerning
this dark one or his insidious plans, but that is of no matter since either
way him, and they, must be stopped. All avenues of knowledge have been
depleted, save one. Long ago there was a library that housed the greatest
works of that time, alas the way to that place has been cut off by some dark
force. I do not think it a coincidence. Find now a way to this library in 
the
town of Arlysia, speak to whoever you can, be it someone who has traveled 
far,
or those who rely on fortune to find their way. Whatever it takes you must
find this library and return to me with whatever KNOWLEDGE you have 
learned."
The neutral lord then turns his thoughts inward and speaks no more.
<p>

*** Find Ancient Gypsy Woman ***

ask wom grey lord
<p>

The gypsy woman gazes at you, "So you know of the Grey Lord..."

You tell her of the mission you have been sent on and the help you were told
you would receive. The gypsy woman nods her head, "True I am indebted to the
Grey Lord, though it is for a favour before we walked the thin line of
Neutrality. Very well, as you represent the Grey Lord, you shall even the
scales. What he asks is no easy task and so, to truly even our balance,
another favor must be done for me, and it is you that must carry it out." 
She
pauses for a moment and begins a slow chant, she abruptly claps her hands 
and
a fog appears showing you an image. The image is that of a aging man in fine
clothes, with a look of animal terror on his face. You notice that his eyes
twitch with unusual agility, and it almost seems like they bulge into 
clusters
at times. The gypsy's aged voice returns you from the image. "That is the
shell of the Mayor of Arlysia, he was once a man of nobility, but the 
disease
that has befallen this land has effected him as well, he does not know it 
but
something has infused him with a horrid abomination of undeath, an
Arachnigoth. A spider of great unholy power that is soon about to come forth
from it's shell and devour the souls of the crippled town", a look of 
sadness
flashes across  her wrinkled face, "He was always a fair man to me and my
people, he does not deserve such an end. To draw out the beast you must slay
the mayor." This causes her a pause, and she continues again, "I also 
require
that you bring  back one pile of it's spectral webbing that it will surely
drop upon it's death. Return this WEBBING to me, and we shall get to the
business of the dark power that threatens the balance we must protect."

<p>

*** Kill the Mayor Of Arlysia, and collect 1 webbing <dont' need all 5> ***
<p>

ask wom webbing
<p>

The gypsy gazes at you, a look of despair in her milky eyes...

You give the webbing to the old gypsy.
The wise woman nods her head slowly, "I thank you for completion of this 
task
traveler, and now to business we shall begin." Again the gypsy pauses, and
with a clap of her hands a cloud appears from thin air. Inside the cloud you
see a tumultuous lake, huge waves tossing back and forth. Suddenly an island
comes into view, a creation of horror, and dark island with a fortress of
bones within the center. The gypsy begins her tale, "You are viewing what 
was
the Crystal Lake, and the island that lies in the center of it. While I 
still
am researching I have determined the resident within is the source of all 
our
troubles,  the island became this almost a year ago, after the disappearance
of he who was called Valion Darkbane. Events seem to unfold that show the 
one
called Zanthus is about to return, and the prophecy of plague is about to
occur, most likely at the same time." Without warning the cloud explodes 
with
a loud flash, the stench of death is thick in the air. You can tell the 
woman
did not expect this as she rubs her hands in silent agony. "It would seem my
crying has been caught by our watery neighbor, it is of no matter." She
continues with her tale, "I was but a young giorvan when Zanthus himself was
banished, but I clearly remember the events there after, one who was called
Helvectus, a young farmer's boy at the time, but it became very clear that
Zanthus had dug his claws into that boys soul." The ancient shakes her head
sadly, "Helvectus followed in his master's footsteps and learned all he 
could
when it came to death and dark arts. He joined the library and became known 
to
have strange habits, which eventually lead to his banishment." Her face 
seems
to drift off into a vision of long ago, but she quickly recovers. "This is
merely speculation on my part but it is my belief that Helvectus is he 
within
the island of bone, and he is attempting to join his master by bringing 
about
his prophecy, and enacting his own, the prophecy of plague. Your next task 
now i
s one of peril, but necessary." Another cloud appears and shows a horrific
abomination, a massive black tree with humanoid limbs hanging from all
branches. "The Hanging Tree as it is called, once it was used for justice,
but now it has been corrupted, you must slay the creation of evil, and take
it's wicked heart from it. I wish only to see it, but you must ultimately 
take
it to the old hermit that guards the library of Arlysia, inside the library
you will find more answers. Come back when you have the HEART."  The cloud
vanishes and she lies back, exhausted from her story.
<p>

*** Kill the Hanging Tree ***
<p>

A mammoth crack appears in the center of the perversion of nature and it 
falls
over, splitting in two. A great gush of blackness floods out from both open
ends, causing rot and decay to assault your nostrils like a battering ram. 
You
identify a filthy black piece of wood in the bottom half of the tree that
appears to be the heart which you were sent to recover. Grabbing onto it, it
seems unusually warm and splatters the foul midnight fluid all over your
hands. With all your strength you rip it free of the stump, and a final 
death
wail is uttered by the tree.
<p>

*** Now Return to Gypsy Woman ***
<p>

ask wom heart
<p>

Noticing her wagon seems more messy then when you left it,
you shake the ancient gypsy woman, she doesn't seem responsive...


With a great pounding force you are struck with the realization that the 
gypsy
woman has been attacked! You check for signs of life, and a shallow rattle
escapes her ribcage, showing her still breathing. It is evident whoever did
this had sinister plans in mind, most likely whoever is on the island. You
decide you must take the artifact of evil to the hermit with great haste.
<p>

*** Find Old Hermit ***
<p>

ask old gift
<p>

The hermit gives you a leer...

The old man lets out a wicked cackle as you hand him his gift.
The old man clutches his gift greedily, and hands you a jagged bone key,
"With this ye may open the door to the library." His old eyes suddenly 
alight
with mischief and he grins, saying "Consider ye warned that the place is not
the great monument of knowledge and peace it once was."  With a final cackle
the hermit tells you, "Be sure to stay out of the Inner Sanctum, people tend
to get cranky if you be disturbing them in there." Lastly he adds, "Should 
you
ever misplace your key, you may remind me of this, and I may happen to have
another on me."
<p>

*** Now Kill Rotting Beholder ***
<p>

*** Now Talk to Old Man (Maxmillion) ***
<p>

ask old prophecy
<p>

Maxmillion nods his head, "It is a curse of many names that all take the 
same
path. The one who invokes the prophecy becomes a terrible creation of dark
power. One who corrupts the balance and destroys all around him."  He gives
you a strange cackle with a toothy grin. "It's very simple really, and only 
a
matter of time." He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. He seems to
meditate before he begins, "Long ago I was under the tutelage of a mad man 
by
the name of . He was obsessed with this very rite. Unfortunately I learned 
as
much as him and thus caused my downfall for his dark apprentice has captured
me and held me here so that he may know the steps. I speak this freely 
because
I have given up hope that anything else can be done, and so I begin. Through
the use of blackest magic he can begin a transformation of himself which
causes a loss of the natural body and devouring of his spirit. As you may
guess he becomes a shell of undeath. Someone who belongs no more to the land
of living or death. This shell still leaves most of his mind intact but as
always insanity sets in when one fools with their own mortality. Using the
heart of a dead monster of great evil he opens a link between himself and 
the
negative planes, which becomes the source of his dark power, for the plane 
is
infinite in evil and death. The heart is placed within a container of some
sort, so that it stays living even in death." The old man starts to wheeze.
"Once in this form he has power over the souls of his enemies, with a finger
he can blot them from existance, with a wave he can drain their life, with a
sweep he can destroy an entire town. There is no thing against him which can 
sto
p his power, he will become a diety
of death and death shall walk the land as soldiers of his blasphemous army."
He begins to look very somber. "The full prophecy is one man shall invoke 
the
rite, and he shall become as death, and he will link a dark fold to the 
realm
and all shall be vanquished by him." You can tell the story has taken alot 
out
of him and his aged skin stretched like dried papyrus over his bones, turns
starkly pale as he slumps to the ground. Finally he gasps out in ragged
breaths "Take...tongue and eye...go...island...shall find...seek...stop
him...shall come again."

<p>
ask old portal<br>
He begins to shake as his hands move in mystical patterns, a sliver of
darkness  appears in the air and begins to grow, the room seems to shake and
then,
You find yourself...elsewhere.
<p>

*** Find Hideous Face ***
<p>

at the face,

place eye in socket<br>
place tongue in hole<br>


A strange howl erupts from the hideous face!
The hideous face vanishes, leaving a mirror in it's place!
<p>

go portal, find dragon
<p>

kill dragon & the ancient tapestry
<p>

after killing the ancient tapestry, it will become a shreaded tapestry

go tapestry when you are ready for the mage...
<p>

*** Kill the Dark Mage***
<p>

You gain 4,000,000 experience!
Cackling insanely the dark mage says to you, "I Zanthus will not be stopped 
by
pathetic worms like you. Hurry now back to Silvermere, for soon the town 
shall
be plunged in the grip of Death!" He vanishes within the portal, laughing 
with
glee. The yellow portal of bone beckons you on, the crushing defeat of 
failure
weighing upon you, feeding your need for revenge.
<p>

*** Rest up, and Enter Portal ***
<p>

Kill Zanthus the Lich

You gain 4,000,000 experience!
<p>

go portal once more and...

You step near the portal, and are suddenly consumed by it!
Cold, chilling numbess surrounds you. All is black, and you feel as if you 
are
in a vaccuum that is devouring your soul.  Suddenly you are high above in 
the
air, overlooking a city that looks ......hauntingly familiar.....yet this 
city
is none like you have seen before, full of corruption and death. A horrid
stench rises up causing you to choke and gag.... Something is pulling at 
you,
tugging at your life strings! You feel yourself drawn to the far side, the
eastern side, but it's not where it would be!  You descend rapidly towards 
it
and yet abruptly come to a halt. A great tug of war ensues over you, and you
find yourself flung backwards through the streets. A loud thud drops you in
the middle, but no one seems to notice..... To the south you see a dark,
wretched tower, rising over the city like a skeletal finger. East is a
gargantuan fortress of blackness. North is a land filled with the poor, the
plagued and the wretches. You are certain now you have never been here, and
yet the buildings tug at your mind.  Unexpectadly you are surrounded by 
black
armoured men, with skulled great helms, and cruel weapons....then a portal
appears, causing them to snarl and back away! You are sucked in and then.... 
A
plane of black surrounds you, only a single silver light draws your notice.
Without thought you are at the source. It is the Timelord! Yet it is not.
Various differences are about him, before you can contemplate further his
voice echoes in your mind: "Spare your curiousity for what you have just
witnessed. Too soon you shall experience it personally. Destiny is taking 
more
control now, and the master of the pawn that was Zanthus is moving again. 
You
however are no pawn, your path must be chosen, if you do not pick, Destiny
shall pick for you. Such is the way of things. Forces must be aligned for 
the
next Great Struggle. You shall be in it whether where you have been, or 
where
you can go. The struggle of the Three shall continue, until the cycle of 
this re
alm ends. Yet many strive to ruin it, in their interest.
Zanthus  was only the first, many shall come after...."  He nods his head. 
"Go
now, wait for the next challenge." And then, you are somewhere else....
<p>

Pier
Also here: boatman.
Obvious exits: north, south
<p>

*** Return to Grey lord with the KNOWLEDGE you found ***
<p>

ask the knowledge
<p>

You feel the Grey Lord's impassive gaze upon you...


You quietly inform the Grey Lord of your travels to Arlysia, contact with 
the
ancient gypsy, and eventual knowledge gained from Maxmillion concerning the
prophecy which Zanthus prepared. He takes all of this in with his same
impassive stare, showing nothing of emotion. Finally you speak of your 
failed
attempt at destroying the newly created Lich. You note with some distress 
the
slight frown that approaches on the neutral one, before it quickly vanishes.
Finally his voice is heard in your mind,  <Indeed your effort is 
commendable,
however the results are less then ideal.  It would seem our forces are at
their most weakest while this darkness gains more in power and might. Though
he surely must rest to have fashioned this portal into a Shadow World, but 
all
too soon he shall surely come forth again with the forces of this blackest
prophecy in his grasp.>   A piece of grey silk appears before you, covering
something which seems to expand and contract, the Grey Lord signals you to
take it and you grasp the silk and place it in your inventory. You turn back
to him only to see him wave you away. His voice faintly echoing in your
skull..   <Once again we await his move before we may work against him, it 
is
not often the forces of Balance are the ones who are the pawn, but his 
powers
of stealth leave us no other option. Rest now, Bound One, all your energy 
will
be needed for our next battle.
