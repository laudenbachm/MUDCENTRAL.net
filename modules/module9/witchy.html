:ask huge witchunter


The huge dwarven witchunter screams, "Ye already got yer weapon, maggot!"
The huge dwarven witchunter eyes you steadily before handing you a rolled
parchment and an obsidian key. "I've recieved word from an old friend, one of
the fort's holding at bay a wicked wench is in dire need of reinforcement,
luckily ye look to be just the maggot for the job, even if I may doom our
entire order by sending such a worthless, festering goat kidney as yourself."
"Take these to the lava fields, look around down there for the Fortress of
Flame, find Fulgore, make something of yerself and help him out. Also be sure
to keep that parchment with ye, and let no one touch it, that parchment is
your safe passage to Fulgore, anyone else they kill on sight." He gives you
a huge slap on the back and lets out a belly laugh, "It's about time someone
got some worth outta ye!"

Thorand, dire times have caused the writing of this letter. The fortress is
weakening, and Xarthick has fallen to temptation, the she-devil has gotten to
him. If you have any one that can aid us, send them now. I do not think we can
last another fortnight. Give them this parchment so my men know not to fight
them, they do not trust anyone else.

:greet fulgore
Aragorn peeks in from the north!
At first the old man doesn't respond and his eyes widen, as if locked in some
dreadful nightmare that he can't escape. Finally he is able to return to
reality, and turns his head to you in a daze asking "Are you the Messenger of
Tribulation?" Without waiting for reply he faces forward again, as if being
forced to begin a new nightmare.

:ask fulgore Messenger


The old man gazes at you, at first showing no reaction, then he starts
laughing, a laugh twinged with insanity and hope. "At last ye came, I hoped
word would reach me short friend in Rooder, and it looks as though it has." A
look of concern crosses his sleepless face and he hands you an obsidian key.
He clasps his hands over yours, as if to ensure the safety of the key. "This
key is the only thing standing between the *demoness* and her freedom, guard it
with yer life, or doom us all." His hand shaking he points out his door,
"Before ye is a task no one can envy, you must slay the madman in the
war-room, I once knew him as a friend but his foley has brought this fortress,
our very order at risk. There is a pair of levers you must pull upon which
opens the way into the hot pits below us, where the door to the hellish temple
resides." A long, ragged sigh escapes him "We were never able to destroy it,
so this fortress was built, ages ago, to contain it." His eyes grow wild for a
moment. "Quickly ye must hurry, even now she knows of ye, and is summoning her
minions, use the key, and slay her, *return* to me her head when ye be through!"
He then starts to break down, sobbing hysterically.

:ask fulgore demoness
He shakes his head quickly, madness threatening to take control. "I dare not
say her name, but for many ages the *Order* of the Crimson Flame has been sworn
to guard this keep, in this prison of hers for eternity." Tears streak his
face and you are shocked by how brittle this man's mentality is, considering
him a high-rank among those known for great willpower. "It be the duty of many
an Inquis'tor to serve time at this place, ours is struggle against forces
such as her. Our order was formed to purify magi evils where we could, or
imprison those we could not. The keep by Verstaag, near Arlysia houses such a
foe. The fortress in the Swamp of Tharollok also contained a foul kang diety,
though I heard his followers aided with demon-spawn freed it." An uneasy sigh
leaves him, "It has been so long since word has been recieved from Grand
Inquisitor Dulram, one can hope we not be the last bastion of Order left in
this realm."

Someone yells from the north "any luck?"
:"long ass story
:You yell "long ass story"
:ask fulgore order
His eyes close for some time and then he opens them, his face wrinkles as if
remembering a story told long ago. "The Order of the Crimson Flame, what any
self respecting hater of mages and other things foul would consider them self
a part of." His face takes on a light of youth, remembering deeds of long ago.
"It was founded after the Great War and the catastrophe of Jurard, many an
angry sword was taken up against spellthrowers that day." He gives an evil
wink and conspiratorial chuckle. "The main bastion of the Order resides in a
fortress of stone, carved from the face of Mount Lornel, and other castles
have been made as required by the forces of evil at that time, many a battle
has been fought against gluttonous magic guilds, or religions preaching peace
and war alike." The old man raises a tired hand as if brushing away an
unwanted memory. "If ye have no been to Mount Lornel ye should look for it
someday, the view it has from the Academy is quiet a sight to behold."
Someone yells from the north "what does he tell you to do?"
You hear movement to the north. 

:ask fulgore return


With almost child-like glee the man directs you to place the head upon the
floor, then he takes out a vial of a green liquid and begins to douse the head
with it, quickly the liquid takes effect and begins to slowly eat away at the
severed head, in mere minutes it is no more but a black, burnt scar on the
floor. He bows to you, and hands you something covered in a piece of crimson
silk. "Take this and accept on behalf of the Order, ye've done it a great
deed, and though tis not quiet official as if we were on the Mount, it is the
best of the situation. Also take with you the summons I gave, so that the
guards shall know you legitimately carry that medal as one of our Order." He
bows again, "Now excuse me, plans must be made to assault the temple below, to
clean out the remaining filth." He then turns back and begins writing plans
on his table. You open the silk and look at the white medal he has given you.

-HP=709 709,$$="120000":ask huge draka
The huge dwarven witchunter gives you a stern look and growls in
disapproval...
With a snort the dwarf turns his eyes away. "Very well crawler, I tell ye
what I knows about the great and mighty Draka." He takes a deep breath and
plunges into the story. "Draka was a great and powerful witchunter in our order at
that time, I suspect now it was his undoing. He traveled many places and
gave honour and good fortune to our order. One place he was fond o' was Arlysia,
he called it his second home if you believe such sentimental garbage. Anyway
things be fine and dandy they do, until one day some big wig panzy dancin'
kai guy thinks he can start swingin' it over his shoulder, and because o' that
he starts hasslin' the innocent farmers in the area." The dwarf scowls as he
recites the next part. "Soon he goes on a rampage and kills plenty o' poor
bastards to go around. Well our good ol' boy gets frazzled, whiskers n' all,
so against me behest he goes to chase down our so called Enigma Lord, and
finds 'im sure enough in the forest. Slimey bastard goes off and runs like
there was no tomorrow, which is makin' sense since there really wasn' gonna
be one." The dwarf chuckles evilly and continues. "So good Draka, justly
bastard until the end, corners the cowardly mystic wimp, and beats him down with
that beautiful sword o' his. Thinkin' he had the guy slain just cause he is in
the lake, Draka mosies on over to town, lickin his wounds." The witchunter grows
somber for a moment, his face begins to darken. "Well no sooner as he hits
the town, he starts to get all thirsty, gets himself a drink of water from some
old hag in a shawl and dies! Damn old hag was the Enigma Lord!" The large
dwarf is practically shaking in rage as he
speaks those words. He has to pause for a moment and continues. "Anyway long
story short, the villain of this tale starts o' gloatin' and me boy Draka
takes his trusty blade, cleaves the bastard mystic in two!" The dwarf lets
out a great nasty chortle that shakes his whole body. "So be that as it may,
this may be some sort of tragedy, so you best go and be payin'a ---visit--- to
Draka right quick or I best be gettin' some money for you wastin' me time!"

-HP=709 709,$$="120000":ask huge visit
The witchunter snorts at you...

"Very well, here be the key, Draka is in the tomb on the far western corner
of the graveyard, pay your respects to him there! Now begone, I have work I
must attend to!" He hands you a key before turning away, hastily find something
to do, a vain attempt to once again try and to forget the past.

The spirit bows to you, "Greetings traveler, I applaud your coming for you
must have great strength to have come this far, I wish I could possess
strength such as yours to leave this prison, but alas magical bonds hold
me." He pauses for a moment, as if trying to remember something. "I know I have
been imprisoned here long, scrounging what I can in this hole, how fare
things on the outside world, do you have news from my good friend

---Armandriel---."

-HP=653 709,$$="120000": ask drak armandriel
You inform him Armandriel is doing well enough, and that things do not bode
well for the town of Arlysia. The feline ghost is very somber with this
news, finally he says, "Well were it not for these bonds that have held me here
for..." he pauses for a moment, his whiskers twitching in deep thought.
"Longer then I can remember, I would ask you to aid me in my escape but I
sense these invisible chains which hold me are cursed and I must escape them
of my own accord." His feline gaze considers you for a moment.
The feline smiles broadly, his sharp fangs shining even in death,
"You, fellow mageslayer, will do nicely."
His voice takes on a conspiratorial tone, "Now I recognize the need is great
for you to go in my stead as champion of this land, but I must see some sign
that I will not be dashing a kitten to fend off the advances of wolves." His
eyes pause in consideration. "The corruption of the Enigma Lord is present
even now, one of the few things I remember before my treacherous capture is
the cleaving of his head from his neck. Bring to me this grisly artifact so
I may know, at least in my imprisonment, that I did succeed in ending his evil
reign." With a cheshire grin he tells you "Bring back to me the head of my
nemesis as proof that you deserve the use of my armour and weaponry." He
stands up straight, obviously proud of his task. "---Return--- to me with
this device of evil and I shall destroy it and allow you to use my tools of
righteousness to drive the corruption from the town of Arlysia."

HellSpawn hums a little tune.

This broadsword is crafted from rare black metal. The blade itself appears
to have lost its luster but its edge gleams due to the sharpness of it. Etched
into its simple handle is the name "Draka", obviously it's original owner.
Thoughts of great and mighty deeds flash in your mind as you heft the
weapon.
