ask chan missions

<p>
Annora suddenly looks very haggard and you wonder when the last time she had 
a
good sleep was. She takes a drink of water from a nearby cup, sits in her
chair and turns to you.  "We have received grave news from our contact in
Arlysia, it is believed that the problems with the so called 'prophecy' and
these problems in Arlysia are related. Other occurences have been appearing
through out the realm, nightmares coming to life, there are very few agents 
of
our cause that can aid our contact and you, for better or worse, are one of
those agents. Now due to the avalanche the normal road to Arlysia is still
blocked other means will need to be used to travel there. Make haste now to
the gypsy encampment nearby to Orfeo's Inn. When in the town of Arlysia you
must find the Pastor there speak my name and he will tell you what to do. 
Help
him however you can, return when you have KNOWLEDGE of the link between
Arlysia and the dark mage." Saying that she closes her eyes, desperate for
rest.

<p>
*** Find Pastor Landor in Arlysia ***
<p>
ask pas annora
<p>
Pastor Landor looks at you sternly, "Many years have gone by since I heard
that name.."
Giving him greetings from Annora you tell him of the dire circumstances 
which
have brought you here, and why you have need of his aid. The Pastor bows to
you, "Indeed your mission is very urgent, I am so glad to see a face I can
trust in these deceitful times. I suspect the answers that we both seek may 
be
found in the library, however some old hermit has taken it upon himself to
block all passage into the library without retrieving some very bizarre
items."  Lander pauses a moment. "What he has asked for is the gem of 
Ozrinom,
the undead lord. I know not why he would make such a dark request but he is
very adamant about getting his way. It has been long since I have left this
chapel, let alone, confronted the minions of the dead one, so I am of little
help until you receive the gem. One may know of this however, Dawnstar 
willing
if his spirit still walks this land, I bid you traveler to go make your way 
to
the white oak forest of the north, you can travel via the treacherous lake.
Since the curse began the lake has been filled with nothing but blood, 
demons,
and a current of death. You must travel to the center  of the white forest 
and
seek out the Ghost of Justice Darkbane, he will be able to aid you. I wish I
could do more my friend, but my efforts are best set to fending off the fear
that is seeping into this town. Do your best, Dawnstar be with you." He then
nods his head towards you and turns to his altar in prayer.
<p>
*** Find Ghost of Justice Darkbane ***
<p>
ask gho pastor landor
<p>
Justice Darkbane arches a ghostly eyebrow at you...

You speak to him of the message the Pastor asked to pass on, and the urgency
of your mission from Annora. His brow furrows even further. Finally he 
speaks,
"Indeed the times are dire if the Pastor requires the gem of Ozrinom, for
Ozrinom is most powerful to defeat for such a trinket. As I can sense from
your travels you have encountered his minions already, those of the undead
that feed off the blood of the living, indeed I speak of the vampire." The
ghost gives you a stern look, "Be wary of these monsters for they are very
powerful, and Ozrinom is the most mightiest and evil by far. He has built a
most clever place of rest in the Arlysian graveyard, for his mausoleum is 
one
of the many found there. I have only invaded that place a handful of times,
but as he is ancient in years he is also unchanging in methods. You must 
find
two statues on the first two floors, then on the bottom floor find your way 
to
the center of the crypt for that is where he shall be. Do not believe you 
can
destroy him for he has an abode hidden away deep in the earth, not possible 
to
reach by mortal means." With that he bows to you, "Best of luck, for you 
will
need all you can spare."
<p>
*** Kill Ozrinom, and Tip over his coffin ***
<p>
As the last wisps of the death mist vanish you are left with the newly 
vacant
casket. Gingerly you look inside to see if you can find any trace of what
you've shed blood and sweat for. Inside you find the largest gem you have 
ever
seen in your life. Easily a foot and a half in diameter it seems as light as 
a
feather. Using as much care as you can muster after the brutal fight into 
this
fortress of death, you take the gem.
<p>
*** Return to Pastor Landor ***
<p>
ask pas gem
<p>
The temple seems unusually quiet, you approach the Pastor who appears to be
praying...
With great horror you realize the altar of Dawnstar has been desecrated, the
Pastor assaulted. Villains, with great malice, destroyed the altar with 
their
weapons. Landor's life blood flows freely from the broken sun. A cough 
escapes
him and you realize he is still barely alive, moving closer he recognizes 
you
and speaks, "Though the circumstances dire, the time is not for you to 
avenge
this deed, take with you the gem to the old hermit in front of the library.
Make great haste in your search for knowledge, even now I hear Dawnstar
telling me what evils will take place should you fail. More then Arlysia is 
at
stake so wait no further!" His eyes close, perhaps for a final time, despite
your initial holy rage, you decide it best to honour his wish.
<p>
*** Find Old Hermit ***
<p>
ask old gift
<p>
The hermit gives you a leer...

The old man lets out a wicked cackle as you hand him his gift.
The old man clutches his gift greedily, and hands you a jagged bone key,
"With this ye may open the door to the library." His old eyes suddenly 
alight
with mischief and he grins, saying "Consider ye warned that the place is not
the great monument of knowledge and peace it once was."  With a final cackle
the hermit tells you, "Be sure to stay out of the Inner Sanctum, people tend
to get cranky if you be disturbing them in there." Lastly he adds, "Should 
you
ever misplace your key, you may remind me of this, and I may happen to have
another on me."
<p>
*** Kill Rotting Beholder ***
<p>
grab his eye, and tongue
<p>
*** Find Old Man (Maxmillion) ***
<p>
ask old
<p>
The withered creature bows and nods to you slightly, dried lips forming
something of a smile. "Greetings visitor, no doubt you are either an 
illusion
sent by the old man, or you are someone sent to stop the dreaded prophecy 
from
occurring." He lets out a dry chuckle at his speculation, "It is of no 
matter,
my name was Maxmillion, once a mage of some worth who taught and studied at
the Daerlorn Academy. Now, as you see, I am just a mere prisoner of 
Helvectus'
apprentice, doomed to live out the remainder of this life in a prison of
filth." He smiles, which ages him even further, "My prison keeper has become
careless however, I have discovered his means of travel, so I can send you 
to
his general location, where you may confront him, be you that foolish. Ask 
me
of my portal spell and I can send you there." A bloody cough escapes his 
lips
and he falls to the floor in a ragged heap.  "My brother would get such a
chuckle  if he saw me in this place now."
<p>
ask old prophecy

<p>
Maxmillion nods his head, "Prophecy of Plague, the Souldrinker, Spirit
Corruptor, it has many names, but they shall all point towards one outcome,
that which he who fulfills the plague desires to be slain, shall be slain, 
and
he that fulfills shall be given the souls of his enemies." He gives you a
strange cackle with a toothy grin. "It's very simple really, and only a 
matter
of time." He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. He seems to meditate
before he begins, "Thanks to my research I have a great deal of expertise in
this. Unfortunately this has caused my downfall for the dark apprentice has
captured me and held me here so that he may know the steps. I speak this
freely because I have given up hope that anything else can be done, and so I
begin. Through the use of blackest magic he can begin a transformation of
himself which causes a loss of the natural body and devouring of his spirit.
As you may guess he becomes a shell of undeath. Someone who belongs no more 
to
the land of living or death. This shell still leaves most of his mind intact
but as always insanity sets in when one fools with their own mortality. 
Using
a gem of great portion and power he places in it a link to himself and the
negative planes, this is what keeps him from turning to dust, thus you can
only destroy him by destroying the gem, otherwise will just be recreated to
his shell once more." The old man starts to wheeze. "Once in this form he 
has
power over the souls of his enemies, with a finger he can blot them from
existence, with a wave he can drain their life, with a sweep he can destroy 
an
entire town. There is no thing against him which can stop his power, he will
become a diety of death and death shall walk the land as soldiers of his
blasphemous army." He begins to look very somber. "The full prophecy is one
man shall invoke the rite, and he shall become as death, and he will link a
dark fold to the realm and all shall be vanquished by him." You can tell the 
sto
ry has taken alot out of him and his aged skin stretched
like dried papyrus over his bones, turns starkly pale as he slumps to the
ground. Finally he gasps out in ragged breaths "Take...tongue and
eye...go...island...shall find...seek...stop him...shall come again."
<p>

ask old dark fold
<p>
"It is not known where the dark fold comes from, not much is even known 
about
the dark fold, but enough experiments have gone wrong that theories have 
been
created." He seems to lighten up and takes a tone as if he were back 
lecturing
at his academy. "It has been theorized that there are places in the universe
where things can be much like a world of our own, but with vary differences,
these have been termed "folds". The term "dark fold" comes from the theory
that there is a fold in the universe where everything about that world has
become corrupted and evil, very little things of good exist in this place. 
It
is a cruel and harsh realm where evil rules supreme and the weak are 
consumed
by the strong. Through ancient text it has been surmised that it is possible
to link the two together, with catastrophic consequences, the process is not
known but it can only be assumed to be through diabolical means."
<p>
ask old portal
<p>
He begins to shake as his hands move in mystical patterns, a sliver of
darkness  appears in the air and begins to grow, the room seems to shake and
then,
You find yourself...elsewhere.
<p>
*** Find Hideous Face ***
<p>
at the face,
<p>
place eye in socket<br>
place tongue in hole<br>


A strange howl erupts from the hideous face!
The hideous face vanishes, leaving a mirror in it's place!
<p>
go portal, find dragon
<p>
kill dragon & the ancient tapestry

after killing the ancient tapestry, it will become a shreaded tapestry
<p>
go tapestry when you are ready for the mage...
<p>
*** Kill the Dark Mage***
<p>
You gain 4,000,000 experience!
Cackling insanely the dark mage says to you, "I Zanthus will not be stopped 
by
pathetic worms like you. Hurry now back to Silvermere, for soon the town 
shall
be plunged in the grip of Death!" He vanishes within the portal, laughing 
with
glee. The yellow portal of bone beckons you on, the crushing defeat of 
failure
weighing upon you, feeding your need for revenge.
<p>
*** Rest up, and Enter Portal ***
<p>
Kill Zanthus the Lich

You gain 4,000,000 experience!

go portal once more and...
<p>
You step near the portal, and are suddenly consumed by it!
Cold, chilling numbess surrounds you. All is black, and you feel as if you 
are
in a vaccuum that is devouring your soul.  Suddenly you are high above in 
the
air, overlooking a city that looks ......hauntingly familiar.....yet this 
city
is none like you have seen before, full of corruption and death. A horrid
stench rises up causing you to choke and gag.... Something is pulling at 
you,
tugging at your life strings! You feel yourself drawn to the far side, the
eastern side, but it's not where it would be!  You descend rapidly towards 
it
and yet abruptly come to a halt. A great tug of war ensues over you, and you
find yourself flung backwards through the streets. A loud thud drops you in
the middle, but no one seems to notice..... To the south you see a dark,
wretched tower, rising over the city like a skeletal finger. East is a
gargantuan fortress of blackness. North is a land filled with the poor, the
plagued and the wretches. You are certain now you have never been here, and
yet the buildings tug at your mind.  Unexpectadly you are surrounded by 
black
armoured men, with skulled great helms, and cruel weapons....then a portal
appears, causing them to snarl and back away! You are sucked in and then.... 
A
plane of black surrounds you, only a single silver light draws your notice.
Without thought you are at the source. It is the Timelord! Yet it is not.
Various differences are about him, before you can contemplate further his
voice echoes in your mind: "Spare your curiousity for what you have just
witnessed. Too soon you shall experience it personally. Destiny is taking 
more
control now, and the master of the pawn that was Zanthus is moving again. 
You
however are no pawn, your path must be chosen, if you do not pick, Destiny
shall pick for you. Such is the way of things. Forces must be aligned for 
the
next Great Struggle. You shall be in it whether where you have been, or 
where
you can go. The struggle of the Three shall continue, until the cycle of 
this re
alm ends. Yet many strive to ruin it, in their interest.
Zanthus  was only the first, many shall come after...."  He nods his head. 
"Go
now, wait for the next challenge." And then, you are somewhere else....
<p>
Pier
Also here: boatman.
Obvious exits: north, south
<p>
*** Return to Chancellor Annora with the KNOWLEDGE you recieved ***
<p>
ask chan knowledge
<p>
Chancellor Annora gives you a grave look, hoping for any bit of good news.

You tell Annora of your travels, the loss of Pastor Landor, and the
unfortunate conclusion of the meeting with the Dark Mage. Her eyes close and
she appears to be holding back tears. She opens them again and you wonder if
she has slept at all since your mission began. She gathers her thoughts 
slowly
before speaking,    "Truly this is the gravest of times we have known, I was
hoping to be rid of this problem and yet he continues to become worse each
time."    Another sigh leaves her and she looks as if she would collapse,
taking some time to steady herself, she speaks again.    "Well now we must
wait for him to make his move yet again, and hope we can perform better then
we have in the past. Take time now to rest friend, return to me later and 
let
us both pray this new dark power will not destroy our cause."    She makes a
signal and a priest enters the room, bearing something in a large cloth.
"Take this from our vaults for your hard work during the mission, you have 
my
leave." With that she returns to her chair, exhausted even more by your 
visit.
