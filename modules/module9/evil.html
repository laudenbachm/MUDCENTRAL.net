<p>
ask bal work
<p>
Balthazar chuckles at you with derision, "After that complete and utter
failure from your last mission you dare to consider looking for more work
here?" He waves you away without a second glance, growling, "Leave me be
before I have you slaughtered with the other dogs." As you begin to
contemplate an assassination two guards enter the room. One of them bow and
speaks "Dark Lord, a courier from the Blood.." Balthazar snaps at him, 
"Bring
him in immediately dog!" A person dressed in full black armor save for a 
large
red skull emblazoned upon their breastplate enters. They do a half bow to
Balthazar and present a red scroll tied with black silk. Balthazar 
impatiently
snatches it away, growling all the while. He opens the scroll and 
immediately
begins reading, his eyes widen and the growling continues. Finally he 
finishes
and crumples up the parchment. Turning to the courier he says "Here is your
answer!" and hurls the parchment at the courier, as it strikes him in the 
head
the courier turns into a pillar of flame and vanishes without a sound. As 
the
last pieces of ash fall to the ground the towering lord of evil rages around
the room... "...Lord Nadroj dares defy me!..." "...Will not alliance without
the dark mage destroyed!..." "...Him and his fanatic cult will be crushed if
not for my help!" Finally he stops his tirade and suddenly the great and
mighty Balthazar towers before you, almost blocking out the entire room from
view.  "I require your services once more it would seem, and this time I 
warn
you failure of any type will result in dismemberment!" Balthazar takes a 
deep
breath, and begins flexing his muscles, finally he begins speaking. "I will
make this simple for you, I require the aid of an assistant of mine from 
long
ago. He is the Enigma Lord. You will go to him. You will do what he says. He
will tell you how to find out about this prophecy, this mage, this pig dog
dares to overthrow me!" He pauses to ensure he doesn't get any dumb looks 
from y
ou, finally he whispers. "Go now scum,
return with what KNOWLEDGE you can glean from my assistance, or do not 
return
at all. Speak with the hag near the swamp she can provide you with travel."
Lastly he adds, "And should you run into any cur of the Blood God, slay them
without hesitation!"
<p>
*** Find Enigma Lord ***
<p>
ask enigma
<p>
You are given but a smirk by the Enigma Lord, in a voice of unnatural cold 
he
speaks, "What is it you want worm, has someone sent you as their lackey to 
me,
make it quick or I shall break you in two!"


as enigma balthazar

The mystic raises an eyebrow...

A whispering laugh escapes the lips of the undead mystic as you tell him the
mission you have been sent to accomplish. "So he once again has need of my
services, that buffoon." Jagged teeth appear with the smile on his pale 
face.
"Very well scum, I hope you are well rested, you have alot of work ahead of
you." An devilish chuckle escapes his lips and he leers at you, "I will
certainly enjoy this. For your first task, the great and mighty Arlysia 
holds
the temple of Dawnstar, a deity I mock in my daily meditations, do away with
the Pastor that protects the temple, and desecrate the altar. When the DEED 
is
complete, return to me for more tasks!"


<p>
The Arlysian Temple, Altar
You notice altar of dawn here.
Obvious exits: east, northeast, southeast
<p>
desecrate altar
<p>
With great malice you take your weapons and strike down the altar of the 
sun,
soon your wrath overtakes you and before you know blood has been splashed 
with
great arches over the walls and shattered pieces of the altar, who's you
cannot say. You grimly inspect your handiwork, noting how dim the church has
suddenly become. To your surprise the priest still appears to be breathing.
Walking away, you grant him another day to live so that he may see the
desecration he could not stop.
<p>
ask enig deed
<p>
The kai master flashes you a wicked grin...
<p>
He chuckles, relishing the details of your evil deed as you tell him the
events that lead up to it. "Very good worm, I now promote you to be my lap
dog, rejoice that I did not kill you before you spoke of Balthazar." A
disgusting smirk flashes across his glacial face, and an evil gleam enters 
his
stone eyes. "Your next task is perfect for a lap dog such as yourself, I 
have
seen the prescence of the scum of Nadroj in the forest. It displeases me 
that
they would walk amongst the forest like mere ruffians without paying homage 
to
me. Hunt them out and slay them, I believe Nadroj would have frighteningly
stupid enough to give the leader of that little band some parchment with
orders and such, BRING it to me as proof of their death." He then gives you 
a
quick slap to the face and yells "Go dog, run before you anger me further!"
<p>

***Kill the Dreadlord of Blood, return parchment to Enigma Lord***
<p>

ask eni bring
<p>
The kai master flashes you an evil row of jagged teeth...

You hand the parchment to the Enigma Lord
With childish glee the mystic opens the parchment, snickering with each 
line.
"Some day I must pay Nadroj a visit and show him how to train his troops in
hospitality." The Enigma Lord gazes at you with another leer, "I have good
news for you minion, no longer are you the lap dog, now you have become my
beggar, let there be rejoicing!" He chuckles at his own cleverness before
continuing, "Now then beggar of mine, there is one last task you must
complete, and then you are free from my bond. Somewhere within the 
Blackwood's
there is an encampment of gypsy filth, they have hid from me very well, but
now that I have a lap dog beggar, I am sure they can be found out." From
nowhere a hand strikes you in the face, "Pay close attention scum, the 
leader
of the encampment is an ancient old hag, and on this ancient old hag is a 
long
golden chain. RETRIEVE for me this trinket, and your status as my servant
shall come to a close." His wicked face shows another cheshire grin you have
come to recognize.
<p>
***Kill the Ancient Gypsy Woman, return long golden chain to Enigma Lord***
<p>
The wretched woman finally is struck down, a screeching wail escaping her
cracked lips, Around her waist you see the chain you have been told to seek
out, it glows a mixture of red and yellow. You gingerly remove it from the
waist of the hag and wonder if you almost heard a breath escaping from her
ancient lungs. An ancient hand snakes out, grabbing hard into your wrist, 
you
suddenly find yourself next to the woman's face and her voice sears into 
your
mind, "I foresaw your visit here, and so I also foresee the mystic is 
against
you, he is out to destroy you. Death awaits you unless you even the wage, 
take
this potion and splash him with it before battle." With that her other hand
slips a small vial into yours, as your hand encloses it your palm seems to 
be
set ablaze for a moment. With that the woman is back on the floor, and you
can't hear any breath from her lungs.

<p>
ask eni retrieve
<p>
The Enigma Lord gives you knowing, expectant smirk...

With your final deed complete you show the chain to the mystic, "Ah the 
hermit
will enjoy this." he mumbles as he makes a stabbing gesture in an attempt to
swipe it. You remain the quicker, and he snarls at you viciously, "Blind 
fool,
you should realize by now that Balthazar will meet his doom by the hands of
the Dark Mage, and I intend to be the first to enjoy his collapse!" As he
gracefully moves into a fighting stance you reach for the small vial given 
to
you by the gypsy, a smirk appears on his face and he says, "Weak scum, no
potion of yours will aid you now, prepare for death, it will come for you
quickly!" He jumps at you as you hurl the potion at him, it shatters on his
chest and covers him with a strange black liquid, he howls in great agony 
even
more enraged!

<p>
*** Enigma Lord will now turn Hostile, Kill him too ***
<p>

With a nightmarish roar the Enigma Lord falls to your deathblow, once a 
being
of great and awful power, he is now only a broken puppet, hunched over into 
a
mass of dead flesh. Your former contact vanquished, you decide it best to
continue on to the old hermit and give him the chain for passage into the
library.
<p>
*** Now Seek Out the Old Hermit in Arylsia ***
<p>
ask old gift
<p>
The hermit gives you a leer...

The old man lets out a wicked cackle as you hand him his gift.
The old man clutches his gift greedily, and hands you a jagged bone key,
"With this ye may open the door to the library." His old eyes suddenly 
alight
with mischief and he grins, saying "Consider ye warned that the place is not
the great monument of knowledge and peace it once was."  With a final cackle
the hermit tells you, "Be sure to stay out of the Inner Sanctum, people tend
to get cranky if you be disturbing them in there." Lastly he adds, "Should 
you
ever misplace your key, you may remind me of this, and I may happen to have
another on me."
<p>
*** Kill the Rotting Beholder, Be Sure to have both the Eye and, Tongue he 
drops***
<p>
*** Pull Lever to reach the Old Man (Maxmillion) ***
<p>
ask old

The withered creature bows and nods to you slightly, dried lips forming
something of a smile. "Greetings visitor, no doubt you are either an 
illusion
sent by the OLD MAN, or you are someone sent to stop the dreaded PROPHECY 
from
occurring." He lets out a dry chuckle at his speculation, "It is of no 
matter,
my name was MAXMILLION, once a mage of some worth who taught and studied at
the Daerlorn Academy. Now, as you see, I am just a mere prisoner of 
Helvectus'
apprentice, doomed to live out the remainder of this life in a prison of
filth." He smiles, which ages him even further, "My prison keeper has become
careless however, I have discovered his means of travel, so I can send you 
to
his general location, where you may confront him, be you that foolish. Ask 
me
of my PORTAL spell and I can send you there." A bloody cough escapes his 
lips
and he falls to the floor in a ragged heap.  "My BROTHER would get such a
chuckle  if he saw me in this place now."

<p>
ask old prophecy
<p>
Maxmillion gives you a stern look, "Know I not your true purpose, but I 
sense
some evil in your soul. I will tell you what I know. A terrible power, the 
one
who invokes the prophecy becomes a vile creation of dark power. One who
corrupts the balance and destroys all around him."  He gives you a strange
cackle with a toothy grin. "It's quiet simple really, and only a matter of
time." He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. He seems to meditate 
before
he begins, "Long ago an evil man named Zanthus entered into the Daerlorn
Academy posing as a teacher, in truth he merely wanted to use the resources 
of
the academy for his own means. He became obsessed with magic relating to
death. I became an unknowing student under him, and unfortunately learned as
much as him. I regret those years for it is my cause for imprisonment as his
dark apprentice has captured me and held me here so that he may know the
steps. I speak this freely because I have given up hope that anything else 
can
be done, and so I begin. Through the use of blackest magic he can begin a
transformation of himself which causes a loss of the natural body and
devouring of his spirit. As you may guess he becomes a shell of undeath.
Someone who belongs no more to the land of living or death. This shell still
leaves most of his mind intact but as always insanity sets in when one fools
with their own mortality. He needs a pure gold chain in his possession, 
using
that he uses it to link his power to the negative power plane, the chain 
must
be attached to a container which holds his power, so that he can roam freely 
wit
hout worry of death, for so long as his link is stable he shall be able to
walk again." The old man starts to wheeze. "Once in this form he has power
over the souls of his enemies, with a finger he can blot them from 
existance,
with a wave he can drain their life, with a sweep he can destroy an entire 
town.
There is no thing against him which can stop his power, he will become a 
diety
of death and death shall walk the land as soldiers of his blasphemous army."
He begins to look  very somber. "The full prophecy is one man shall invoke
the rite, and he shall become as death, and he will link a dark fold to the
realm and all shall be vanquished by him." You can tell the story has taken
alot out of him and his aged skin stretched like dried papyrus over his 
bones,
turns starkly pale as he slumps to the ground. Finally he gasps out in 
ragged
breaths "Take...tongue and eye...go...island...shall find...seek...stop 
him...
shall come again."
<p>
ask old dark fold
<p>
"It is not known where the dark fold comes from, not much is even known 
about
the dark fold, but enough experiments have gone wrong that theories have 
been
created." He seems to lighten up and takes a tone as if he were back 
lecturing
at his academy. "It has been theorized that there are places in the universe
where things can be much like a world of our own, but with vary differences,
these have been termed "folds". The term "dark fold" comes from the theory
that there is a fold in the universe where everything about that world has
become corrupted and evil, very little things of good exist in this place. 
It
is a cruel and harsh realm where evil rules supreme and the weak are 
consumed
by the strong. Through ancient text it has been surmised that it is possible
to link the two together, with catastrophic consequences, the process is not
known but it can only be assumed to be through diabolical means."
<p>
ask old portal
<p>
He begins to shake as his hands move in mystical patterns, a sliver of
darkness  appears in the air and begins to grow, the room seems to shake and
then,
You find yourself...elsewhere.
<p>
*** Find Hideous Face ***
at the face,

place eye in socket<br>
place tongue in hole<br>

A strange howl erupts from the hideous face!
The hideous face vanishes, leaving a mirror in it's place!

go portal, find dragon

kill dragon & the ancient tapestry

after killing the ancient tapestry, it will become a shreaded tapestry

go tapestry when you are ready for the mage...
<p>
*** Kill the Dark Mage***
<p>
You gain 4,000,000 experience!
Cackling insanely the dark mage says to you, "I Zanthus will not be stopped 
by
pathetic worms like you. Hurry now back to Silvermere, for soon the town 
shall
be plunged in the grip of Death!" He vanishes within the portal, laughing 
with
glee. The yellow portal of bone beckons you on, the crushing defeat of 
failure
weighing upon you, feeding your need for revenge.
<p>
*** Rest up, and Enter Portal ***
<p>
Kill Zanthus the Lich

You gain 4,000,000 experience!

go portal once more and...

You step near the portal, and are suddenly consumed by it!
Cold, chilling numbess surrounds you. All is black, and you feel as if you 
are
in a vaccuum that is devouring your soul.  Suddenly you are high above in 
the
air, overlooking a city that looks ......hauntingly familiar.....yet this 
city
is none like you have seen before, full of corruption and death. A horrid
stench rises up causing you to choke and gag.... Something is pulling at 
you,
tugging at your life strings! You feel yourself drawn to the far side, the
eastern side, but it's not where it would be!  You descend rapidly towards 
it
and yet abruptly come to a halt. A great tug of war ensues over you, and you
find yourself flung backwards through the streets. A loud thud drops you in
the middle, but no one seems to notice..... To the south you see a dark,
wretched tower, rising over the city like a skeletal finger. East is a
gargantuan fortress of blackness. North is a land filled with the poor, the
plagued and the wretches. You are certain now you have never been here, and
yet the buildings tug at your mind.  Unexpectadly you are surrounded by 
black
armoured men, with skulled great helms, and cruel weapons....then a portal
appears, causing them to snarl and back away! You are sucked in and then.... 
A
plane of black surrounds you, only a single silver light draws your notice.
Without thought you are at the source. It is the Timelord! Yet it is not.
Various differences are about him, before you can contemplate further his
voice echoes in your mind: "Spare your curiousity for what you have just
witnessed. Too soon you shall experience it personally. Destiny is taking 
more
control now, and the master of the pawn that was Zanthus is moving again. 
You
however are no pawn, your path must be chosen, if you do not pick, Destiny
shall pick for you. Such is the way of things. Forces must be aligned for 
the
next Great Struggle. You shall be in it whether where you have been, or 
where
you can go. The struggle of the Three shall continue, until the cycle of 
this re
alm ends. Yet many strive to ruin it, in their interest.
Zanthus  was only the first, many shall come after...."  He nods his head. 
"Go
now, wait for the next challenge." And then, you are somewhere else....
<p>
Pier
Also here: boatman.
Obvious exits: north, south
<p>
*** Now, return to Balthazar with the KNOWLEDGE you gained ***
<p>
as bal knowledge
<p>
Balthazar glowers at you, "Speak quickly!"

You relate your travels into Arlysia and the discoveries you made in the
library, you happen to skip the unexpected travel you took after your final
confrontation, knowing this could mean certain demise at Balthazar's hands. 
A
chill runs down your spine as his chiseled teeth come into view from his
cheshire grin.  "You have done far better then I had anticipated, while the
loss of the mystic is tragic, you merely fulfilled a debt he owed me 
already,
better to have that debt paid then him to die first."  This last sentence
gives him an evil chuckle. "Very well then, you have regained your stature 
as
my most favored subject, take now this trinket of mine from the days of 
yore,
and do what you will until I have need of you again." He hands you a bundle 
of
dark cloth, and turns away.
