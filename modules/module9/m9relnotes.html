 MajorMUD - Realm of Legends                                 Release Notes
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

                   + Version 1.11i + Patch - 1/10/2001 +

1) Fixed crashing caused by Lord of the Hunt, nexus spear, and Dusk.
2) Added a fail safe to the hideous face not appearing
3) The first good and neutral quest now requires you make a full round trip
   from Markus to Annora
4) The witchunter quest in the Crimson Fortress is now repeatable.
5) The doors in the Negative Power Planes are bashable.

                   + Version 1.11i - 12/21/2001 +

1) Area effect spells that cause damage should no longer be resisted by
   monsters.
2) Fixed two crashing bugs caused by a monster and a room spell.
3) Fixed monsters that regenned out of their intended area.
4) Linked rooms that were broken in some areas.
5) Changed the 5th evil quest to give appropriate flags and items so someone
   who did their steps out of order wouldn't be stuck.
6) Enabled the 5th quest to allow someone who didn't follow their quest
   directions in 1.11h to complete their quest.
7) Changed some monster resistances so they will take no damage instead of
   being healed by spells.
8) Fixed other miscellaneous bugs.

                   + Version 1.11h - 11/30/2001 +

1)  Added training to level 65 at the Hydra.
2)  Fixed toplist display for characters that have passed the 4.2 billion
    mark for people previously running the beta patch.
3)  Fixed toplist display for characters that have rerolled and retained 
    some experience for people previously running the beta patch.
4)  Fixed display of experience to next level in the player's exp line for
    people previously running the beta patch.
5)  Added the command "unstock all" for gangshop owners to fix the problem
    where shops did not have all 10 slots available to them.
6)  Fixed several memory related issues that may or may not resolve the 
    NT regen problems in prior versions.
7)  Changed sys jail to become a more effective "time out" for problem
    users. This does *NOT* effect monster jail such as guards or the 
    sheriff. Now, when a player is sent to jail using the sys god
    commands, they will be placed in "isolation" for 30 minutes, where
    they cannot speak, telepath, gossip, auction, broadcast, etc. They
    will only be able to sit and wear their time off or exit the realm. 
    If they exit, their timer does not go away, it takes up where they
    left off when they come back.
8)  Removed quest resetting via the smoky black talisman. Players will
    now be able to "pledge" an alignment after they have completed the
    3rd alignment quest and before they have started the 5th alignment
    quest. This will convert their quest flags to the appropriate 
    equivalent of the new alignment they have pledged. 
9)  Fixed the coding bug that allowed some bbses to access Module 8 areas
    without having purchased an activation code.
10) Level 10 quest weapons are now magic 2, monsters with a magic 3 rating 
    or higher can't be hit. Additionally, level 10 training must be done
    in the crypt now, at the respective quest spirits.
11) A new area has been added that contains a sidequest for witchunters.
    You must purchase Module 8 to access it.
12) A new sidequest has been added for gypsies, this quest is in Module 4.
13) A new sidequest has been added for missionaries, this quest is in Module
    6.
14) A new area has been added that allows access from Module 1 to Module 3
    w/o the amber talisman. 
15) New underground areas have been added that connect Module 1 to Baseline
    and Baseline to Module 4.
16) A new area has been added that directly connects the Darkwood Forest to
    the Slums.
17) The illumination spell now creates a magical "light ball" light item
    which has to be equipped to use.
18) Several new spells have been added for Priest, Bard, Mage and Druid,
    check all spell shops and boss monsters for new scrolls.
19) Some attack spells over level 35 have been upgraded to be more mana
    efficient.
20) Some monsters attacks that were essentially non magical have been
    flagged to be unaffected by magic resistance.
21) Some monster attacks that were based solely on weapon damage, have been
    increased to reflect the strength bonus that the monster would likely
    have.
22) Monsters now cast certain spells the same as players i.e. blind, hold
    person etc.
23) Many changes to existing items, some upgrades, some downgrades.  Make
    sure to experiment with them before going anywhere dangerous.
24) Removed shatter from the game until it can be reworked.
25) Shovels that can be used to dig with in the graveyard now have a random
    chance to break.
26) Capitalized the names of new boss monsters to make them stand out more.
27) Other misc. changes applied and bugs fixed
