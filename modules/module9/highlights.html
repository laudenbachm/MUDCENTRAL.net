<h3>MOD 9 Highlights</h3>

<p><strong>Not to be confused with release notes:</strong><br />
Over 20 new bosses all ready to slay you and friends alike -
You may notice a lot of the bosses have capitalized letters in their names for example: Banished One, or Shadow Master, WCC did this with named monsters like Goru-Nezar or Gudruk, but we figured to try it on for a few bosses that weren't named and see if people preferred this way of marking bosses from non-one's or just let the rgen timers decide, I suppose it doesn't really matter but this is something we'll like feedback on.</p>

<p><strong>New spells for Priest, Druid and Mage:</strong><br />
Some changes were done to old spells, and quite a few new ones added to the stores or older bosses. Some of these include:</p>

<h5>Priest:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Cure Paralysis, Control Undead, Soul Rip</li>
	<li>Priestly healing has been changed to Anointed Hands and is now -2</li>
	<li>Paladins get a spell called Zeal which we have been informed numerous times is something they've needed for awhile.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Druid:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Rejuvenation, Mass Entangle, Shatter is replaced by Burning Aura, 
this is a single target hp ticker, Shatter will be put back in once it can be more versatile.
Rangers get a spell called Natural Prowess, see "Zeal" above.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Mage:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Sleep, Colour Spray, Sphere of Implosion</li>
	<li>Warlocks/Gypsies get 1 of these</li>
	<li>Illumination now conjures a "light ball" torch item, which can be given to anyone the caster desires.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also Mod9 itself has it's own share of spells for the -3.</p> 

<p>Many limited weapons of all types -
A few of them are alignment specific or class specific, and class specific does not mean restricted to a single class for use.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">Some non-limited items dropped include:</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0px;">
	<li>A full set of plate</li>
	<li>A full set of chain-mail</li>
	<li>Completion of the red dragon hide set</li>
	<li>Completion of the crimson scale set</li>
</ul>

<p>Class specific side quests -
and items gained from those quests, one thing mentioned at the GT is a deck of cards for gypsies to portray their own fortune, only one fortune per draw that can't be stacked with Aggie's fortunes,
and the duration is lessened so no needing to dash to the nearest arena.</p>

<p>Over 100 new monsters living and dead, ready to devour you -
The part about more dead monsters should be in bold, there's quiet a few of them. Also fear was given to less then five monsters in the entire Module, so those of you that have a hard time handling it can breathe a sigh...</p>

<p>Powerful weapons to aid your cause upon completion of your 5th alignment quest </p>

<p>Translation: Like the quest cloaks but one for each alignment, and no it's not like the level 10 quest, everyone gets something.</p>

<p>A vast library to learn of the old days of the Realm -
There's also literature in here telling of other locations that the realm will soon be expanded upon, as well as some text giving some idea as to where mod 10 will be.</p>

<p>Riddles to test your wit, some bringing pain and suffering to reward wrong answers - Nothing to add here, heehee.</p>

<p>Clues that show the plan of the Dark Mage, and his final chapter in Mod 10 - See above in the library.</p>

<p>Some interesting additions to older area's -
As said above with the spells, some older monsters will drop them, some older monsters will drop some new items as well.
A new area was added to the Module 8 map with it's own story line, this is for parties of 40+. "Parties" meaning more than 1 and less then 30.</p>

<p>Last but not least, <strong>watch out for the zombies!</strong> 
Three new breeds of zombies, all of them fun.</p>

<p>The bad news everyone probably knows or is dreading to find out:</p>
<blockquote>
Nexus Chakram:<br />
Damage: 10-35<br />
Speed: 2500<br />
Magical +4<br />
Min. Lvl: 40<br />
Crits +5<br />
BS Acc: -20<br />
Casts the same hurl spell done by the nexus hunters,
doing up to 50-100 damage.</blockquote>

<p>And a last bit of info monsters using player like spells such as blind and hold person, now use those actual spells, ie: the undead priest's hold person that used to last for 90 seconds, now lasts 12 seconds, but it now says:<br /><br />
Undead priest casts hold person on you! <br />
as opposed to:<br />
The undead priest casts hold person on you!</p>

<p>We hope most of the players can bear with the message change for the lowering of the duration.</p>

<p>Judge for yourself.
<p>-Izak
