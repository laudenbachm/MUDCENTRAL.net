<table width=448 border=0>

<tr><td><b><font size=5 color=#ffcc33><b>Here's some descriptions of some of the new items...<br><br></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><b><font size=4 color=#008800>Barkskin scroll</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b><p>This thick, weathered bark scroll is inscribed with many passages written in a
bold, flowing hand. Upon scanning its contents, you discover that it contains
the secret methods of learning and casting the Regeneration spell! This
powerful, but short-lived spell rapidly heals the target's wounds.<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><b><font size=4 color=#008800>Holy writ</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b><p>This thin manual describes the ways of properly praying to one's deity in order
to be filled with righteous power! This Righteousness gives the target an
increase in combat power, coupled with a small healing of one's wounds over
time.<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><b><font size=4 color=#008800>Skin-covered book</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b><p>In this unholy manual, you uncover the evil, secret techniques of the blood
ritual! This Blood Ritual allows the recipient to be filled with a minute power
of the Blood God, giving an increase in combat power along with a small amount
of healing over time. This spell is powered by the pain and suffering of
others, and is needless to say quite evil.<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><b><font size=4 color=#008800>Tattered scroll</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b><p>This long, ripped scroll is covered by row upon row of thin, evenly-spaced
handwriting, describing the methods of learning and casting a spell named Mass
Frenzy! This spell duplicates the effects of the Frenzy spell, but is cast upon
oneself and one's allies.<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><b><font size=4 color=#008800>Ruby-eyed skull ring</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b><p>This shining black ring seems to be made out of an unknown dark, glittering
metal, and is extremely cold to the touch. A tiny, perfect dark skull is
affixed to it, its eyes burning with an unnatural red flame. The ring has a
noticeable aura of evil surrounding it, as well as one of extreme suffering.<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><b><font size=4 color=#008800>Shortbow</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b><p>This small curved bow is made out of a light, polished wood. It is tightly
strung, and has a light pull-- it is fairly effective at close range, but has
not the power for extreme range or damage. It comes with a small quiver filled
with arrows.<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><b><font size=4 color=#008800>Crossbow</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b><p>This powerful weapon is comprised of a small, but extremely
 powerful metal bow
affixed to a two-foot-long wooden stock. The bow is extremely difficult to
cock, making this a slow weapon-- but its steel-tipped bolts can pierce through
armour with ease. It comes with a quiver full of short, sharp bolts.<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><b><font size=4 color=#008800>Serrated battle axe</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b><p>This is a large double-bladed axe, used in one hand. Its huge serrated blades
are sharpened to a razored edge, and jagged runes have been cut into its haft.<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><b><font size=4 color=#008800>Longbow</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b><p>This slender, curved bow is made out of a long branch of supple wood. It is
tightly-strung, and has a fair amount of stopping power. Its pull is a little
heavy, but it makes for a good, accurate weapon. It comes with a quiver full of
black-feathered arrows.<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><b><font size=4 color=#008800>Heavy crossbow</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b><p>This is a more powerful version of the standard crossbow. Its bow is very
tightly strung, and requires much strength to re-cock, making it very slow to
fire. Nonetheless, it is extremely accurate, and armour is nearly useless
against its heavy bolts. It comes with a quiver full of the small, weighty,
steel-tipped bolts it requires.<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><b><font size=4 color=#008800>Sling</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b><p>This is a simple leather thong, with a pouch affixed to its middle. To use, a
stone is placed within the pouch, then the sling is whirled about at great
speeds. When one end of the sling is released, the stone flies at the target.
It comes with a pouch full of smooth, round stones.<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><b><font size=4 color=#008800>Staff-sling</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b><p>This weapon looks like a shortish wooden staff, with a leather sling affixed to
the end. It is able to throw stones faster and further than a normal sling, but
it is slower and requires two hands. It comes with a pouch full of stones to
use.<br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><b><font size=4 color=#008800>Double crossbow</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b><p>This strange contraption appears to be a heavy crossbow with two bows, one on
top of the stock, the other on the bottom! The bolts are held in an ingenious
auto-reloading magazine, which must be reloaded every so often. Cocking both
bows and reloading the magazine makes re-arming this weapon fairly slow, but
the firing of it is quick as lightning.<br><br></td></b></tr>
