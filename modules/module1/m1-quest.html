<p>It all starts here...



<p>Guildmaster's Office

<p>    This office is lavishly decorated, with everything made out of precious

polished woods and glimmering gold. A huge oaken desk dominates the east wall,

behind which sits a large, confidant-looking man. At your entrance, he nods

towards you and grins. You can leave the room through the door to the west.

<p>You notice black star key here.

<p>Also here: Guildmaster.

<p>Obvious exits: open door west



<p>ask gui

<p>The guildmaster looks you up and down, and exclaims, "Well, well, another

adventurer come to see old Cobhan! What be your business, youngster? Are ye

here on personal business, or are ye pursuing a private matter? Perhaps ye're

wondering about the sudden arrival of strangers in Silvermere?"



<p>ask gui strangers

<p>The guildmaster says, "Indeed, three strangers, all within the past few weeks!

One is a nice enough fellow, sent from the western outpost on some sort of

mission. He's in at the Temple gettin' his leg healed, it seems he was thrown

from his horse and gashed it up good. Another spends all his time in the inn,

seemingly waiting for someone. An odd fellow, that one-- always wears a cloak

that nearly conceals everything. The last one is a seedy-looking man, but what

sewer he crawled out of I don't know. He stunk to high heaven, and was always

lookin' around shifty-like, as if he was bein' followed. I didn't like him."



<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>The quests just give you quest rings and 40k of exp.



<p>Hooded Traveller in bar - ask about Neutral Quest.



<p>Wounded Messenger in temple - ask about Good Quest.



<p>Nasty-looking man in Tavern - ask about Evil Quest.



<p>The quest items (rings) are:



<p>EVIL    Ruby-eyed skull ring

<p>NEUTRAL Black and White Serpent ring

<p>GOOD    White Gold Ring



<p>Each ring gives +1 ac +3 hp heal per turn resting +1 hp heal per turn normal



<p>Each person can only do one of the 3 quests. You can only wear Neutral ring 

while neutral/seedy, Evil ring while Outlaw or worse, and Good while good or 

better.
