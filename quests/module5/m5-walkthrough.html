<P>1) Talk to the old man in the Asylum in Rhudaur.
<P>[HP=350/MA=318]:l old
<BR>
old man
<BR>
This old, wizened man is garbed in tattered robes and is chained to the wall.
Despite his advanced age, his gaze is piercing and he appears more than
competent. 
<BR>
It appears to be unwounded.
<BR>
<BR>
[HP=350/MA=318]:gr man
<BR>
The old man looks at you curiously, as if not expecting to see you here. 
<BR>
<BR>
"This is unexpected, " he says with a slight grin, "the only visitors I 
 normally get are nightmares and lunatics who run amok in this haunted place.
 I have been locked up here for years uncounted, and no one of right mind would
 would come here. People are put here to be forgotten, not found."
<BR>
<BR>
[HP=350/MA=318]:ask man forgotten
<BR>
"Yes, I am here because I know something I should not. Undoubtably I should 
 have been slain long ago, but shortly after being imprisoned in this asylum,
 some strange force warped the reality holding this place together, and now it
 is a shifting nightmare realm. It must be that those who would have killed me
 no longer can find me. The Shadow Fist brotherhood are not forgiving."
<BR>
<BR>
[HP=350/MA=318]:ask man shadow fist
<BR>
"Once, I was a powerful and respected member of the Shadow Fist brotherhood,
 second only to the grandmaster himself. Long did I revel in the power afforded
 me, and used it to my own profit and to further the evil cause of the 
 brotherhood. One day, however, I happened upon an ancient scroll in the secret
 library which only the master may enter. Inscribed upon this parchment was a
 prophecy long forgotten, which told about a magical creature named the
 Phoenix, whose name is Bel-Lai."
<BR>
<BR>
[HP=362/MA=329]:ask man phoenix
<BR>
"As I began to read the scroll, I learned that the Phoenix would be 
 instrumental in the struggle between the forces of the light and the dark.
 However, before I could discover more, I was taken by force and imprisoned 
 here until I could be trasported to higher authorities for punishment and 
 execution. Of course, as I already told you, the asylum became warped and I 
 was lost and forgotten."
<BR>
<BR>
"If you would reveal the secrets of the prophecy, you must infiltrate the 
 Shadow Fist brotherhood in Rhudaur and find the hidden library. The front
 entrance to the brotherhood's temple is impenetrable, but there is a secret
 way through the sewers. Even this gate is locked, but there is a skilled thief
 in the thieve's guild who may be able to forge you a skeleton key."

5) Use the wire key you get to open the door north. Then go north and read the parchment.
<P>[HP=389/MA=328]:l parchment
<BR>
<BR>
When the light in the sky flies once again this shall be a sign of the Dark
One's return. The light is of such beauty that it appears with the grace of a
bird, and is given the name Phoenix. The light of such elegance that many a man
fell to his knees in awe of her.
<BR>
<BR>
For the Phoenix represents the rebirthing of the ages. The ages come and go but
the light remains. It is this bond that links all the events of this reality. 
It is the change and the growth of all beings. It is the power that challenges
us to change, and forces us to understand. For it is the universe's tool of
change, and is a tool of great power.
<BR>
<BR>
Towards the end of the last Great War, the great light vanished, gone from the
world of mortals, until the time when the darkness would rise again.
<BR>
<BR>
For the Dark One knew of the Phoenix and knew if he were to catch her that
this would be a testament to his power and a challenge to the other gods. The
Dark One had long been beguiled by the beauty of the Phoenix and became
obsessed with a desire to possess her.
<BR>
<BR>
The great Legends knew of the desires of the Dark One and requested of the 
Phoenix to assist them in their quest to defeat the Dark One's Armies. The
Phoenix, knowing of the danger that the Dark One repre
sented, agreed in
assisting them in their battle against the Lord of Shadows.
<BR>
<BR>
For many months the Legends managed to distract the Dark One with the Phoenix,
until he became obsessed enough to divert his Avatar away from Silvermere and
towards the Phoenix's home, The Stronghold of the Templars of Golden Light, an
ancient society of warriors who gave themselves to the Phoenix as guardians of
her and her ultimate destiny in the realm.
<BR>
<BR>
There the Dark One's Avatar besieged the fortress in a futile attempt to
capture the Phoenix. While this occurred, it gave opportunity to the Legends to
bring their scattered forces to bear on the Dark One. Unfortunately, on the eve
of the Legendary Heroes' assault, The Dark One, who had grown furious at his
Avatar's failure, intervened and violated a sacred law of the realm, using
ancient technology long lost and forbidden in the realm. He succeeded, 
breaching the walls of the stronghold and overwhelming the Templars, who in the
 heat of the battle were unable to stop many of the dark one's heroes from
entering the Phoenix's lair.   Many of the Legends, knowing that they had
failed the Phoenix, retreated with their forces back to Silvermere to await the
final conflict with the Dark One's Avatar. Orfeo Talespinner remained with a
small band of his henchmen and managed to fight his way into the catacombs
where the Phoenix lair was located. Orfeo to this day speaks not of this
experience, only knowing the pain of his failure in stopping the Dark One's
army from taking the stronghold.  With the destruction of the Stronghold, the
Dark One's Avatar turned his attention to the great city of Silvermere, his
last obstacle in conquering the realm. Little did he know that the Legends 
from across the realm had signed an alliance to either defeat the Dark One or
be vanquished in the attempt.  At this last battle the Legends defeated the
Dark One's Avatar. The great mage Morukai, using magics bestowed upon him by
the gods to counterbalance the Dark One's forbidden intervention, countered
many of the Avatar's unholy protective powers. Vulnerable and surprised by the
combined forces of the Armies of Light, the Dark One's Avatar was overrun and
destroyed by Dorshar Lightblade and the other legendary heroes who still
survived.   This resulted in the beginning of a new age, the Age of
Tranquility. With the Dark One's power temporarily broken, the hosts of shadow
fell into disarray and were scattered about the land like chaff on the wind.
The armies of light,  decimated by the terrible war, returned to their
homelands to rebuild and begin the process of healing the scars wrought during t
his time. Only time would will tell the fate of the realm, as the forces of darkness slowly regathered
to fuel the Dark One's unrelenting hunger to control the realm.

<BR>
8) Read the smudged paper.
<P>[HP=389/MA=334]:l smudged paper
<BR>
This small piece of paper has a few lines scribbled on it: "Still no way to get
up waterfall. Shadow Fist brotherhood  will not be pleased. Remember to send
spy to gnome  alchemist to see if any levitation potions available."
<BR>
<CENTER>----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
</CENTER>
<BR>
9) Purchase a potion of levitation (or two?) from the Gnome Alchemist.

"Ahh yes, I believe I still have a few of those potions sitting around here
 someplace... just one minute and I'll look."

<BR>
10) While you're nearby, get a titanium fork from the Gnome Inventor.
<P>Also here: Spike*, big gnome inventor.
<BR>
Obvious exits: open door northwest
<BR>
[HP=389/MA=334]:gr inventor
<BR>
The gnome starts chattering excitedly at your approach.
<BR>
<BR>
"A visitor!" he says, "And just in time! In time for what, you might add? Well,
 watch and see!"
<BR>
<BR>
He pulls out a large, two-tined fork that glitters in the light. With a
flourish, he points it at a large crystal-studded rock, and the fork begins to
vibrate! The rock shudders and cracks, and then splits into rubble.
<BR>
<BR>
"See? My Titanium Wall-Basher reduces certain types of walls to rubble with no
 more effort than it takes to point. All you have to do is aim, and there you
 go! Very useful for some situations! It only works some places, though. Also,
 I have something else you might like to see!"
<BR>
<BR>
With that, he pulls on a strange-looking helmet that covers the mouth and nose.
He walks over to the tall glass tank, dives in, and floats down to the bottom.
Bubbles froth out of the piece covering his mouth, and to your astonishment he
begins to talk in a muffled voice!
<BR>
<BR>
"See? I call it the Breathe-Like-A-Fish-Helmet. Or just the Fish Helm for
 short. It has all sorts of uses, and will revolutionize underwater
 exploration! At least it will, when I work out the problems. For some reason,
 it only works in extremely cold waters. Why that is, I have no idea, but it
 works, it works!"
<BR>
<BR>
He swims to the top of the tank and climbs out, taking the helmet off and
placing on a table.
<BR>
<BR>
"They're so easy to make once you know the trick, so I've made many of them for
 testing purposes. Would you like to try my fine helmet, or test out
 one of my blasting forks?"
<BR>
<BR>
[HP=389/MA=334]:.forks!
<BR>
You say "forks!"
<BR>
Cluttered Workshop
<BR>
Also here: Spike*, big gnome inventor.
<BR>
Obvious exits: open door northwest
<BR>
[HP=389/MA=334]:ask gn forks
<BR>
Beaming happily, he pats your hand and says, "I knew you would be interested.
Please, take one, and tell me what you think of it!"
<BR>
<BR>
l fork
<BR>
This shining titanium device greatly ressembles an oversized two-tined fork,
attached to a strange crystal-studded handle. Of gnomish manufacture, it is a
queer device that only the brilliant gnome inventors could create. 
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
</CENTER>
<BR>
11) See what is above the waterfall. (Note - this step can be skipped :)
<P>Mossy Cave, Waterfall
<BR>
    The dark brown walls of this naturally-formed cave are covered with a pale
green mossy substance. The centre of the chamber is split by a wide gaping
hole. Thundering down from somewhere in the utter darkness up above, a silvery
river falls down through the hole into the depths below. A crude stair leads
down the side of the hole, following the waterfall into the darkness, and a
smooth tunnel leads out to the east.
<BR>
Also here: Spike*.
<BR>
Obvious exits: east, down
<BR>
[HP=384/MA=334]:use lev
<BR>
A tingling sensation comes over you, and you begin to float upwards!
You float up past the waterfall, and land far above at the river's edge.
<BR>
<BR>
Waterfall, Dirt Path
<BR>
Obvious exits: north, down
<BR>
<BR>
Confusing place.. Some walls can be destroyed by typing 'aim fork {direction}'<BR>
If you look around enough you'll end up here:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Catacombs, Shimmering Barrier
<BR>
    Cobwebs cling to the corners and rubble covers the ground of this decaying
underground passageway. The stone of the floor and walls is rapidly breaking
down, and in sections has completely caved in to form mounds of rocky debris. A
strange, rippling field of energy covers the tunnel to the north.
<BR>
Also here: Spike*, haunting spirit.
<BR>
Obvious exits: northeast
<BR>
[HP=389/MA=334]:Spike smiles happily at haunting spirit!
<BR>
[HP=389/MA=334]:l haunting spirit
<BR>
This wispy, translucent apparition is bound to this area in death, and wails
mournfully.
<BR>
It appears to be unwounded.
<BR>
[HP=389/MA=334]:gr haunt
<BR>
The haunting spirit softly moans as you hail it, and turns to face you.
<BR>
<BR>
"Who are you who enters this forgotten catacomb? Long has it been since any
 living being has dared to break the silence of the dead! And longer still
 since Orfeo and his songweavers defended this crumbling fortress..."
<BR>
<BR>
[HP=389/MA=334]:ask haunt orfeo
<BR>
"Aye, the hero Orfeo Talespinner did assault the forces of darkness here, as
 they plunged into these catacombs to steal the Phoenix egg. Alas, their battle
 was in vain, as the Dark One's force partially completed their mission. They
 succeeded in obtaining the Phoenix egg, and would surely have escaped with the
 Dark One's aid had not Morukai the Black sealed off their exit with a spell of
 great power. This magic did not only prevent their exit, but trapped them in
 time. There is no entrance nor exit, nor even normal existance past this
 barrier behind me. And only Morukai knows the ancient rituals and incantations
 to reverse the spell."
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
</CENTER>
<BR>
12) Find Orfeo Tailspinner (at the Inn west of Misty Swamp), and ask him about Morukai.
<P>Common Room
<BR>
    This quiet, comfortable inn speaks of good food and restful sleep. Warm
light glows from lit lanterns and candles, and a pleasant warmth from the
fireplace fills the air. Two large round tables sit in the centre of the room,
and a dozen waiting chairs encircle them. In one chair in the corner is a
strange man, who by the look of it appears to be the owner of this place. A
small arch leads into the kitchen to the west, and a large one leads to foyer
to the south.
<BR>
Also here: Spike*, Orfeo Talespinner.
<BR>

<BR>
Orfeo looks at you quizzically.
<BR>
When you tell him about your discovery of the prophecy, Orfeo sighs resignedly.
<BR>
<BR>
"It has been an age since our battle with the Dark Lord. I had hoped that,
 perhaps, the cycle would not repeat again, and that the lord of shadows would
 remain just a shadow. But if what you say is true, and the prophecy scrolls
 are once more being found, then my hope for peace is shattered. The forces of
 darkness must once more be mustering in secret. I fear for the worst... you
 must go and see Morukai the Black, in his hidden tower deep in the Elder
 Darkwood grove. Only he can destroy the barrier in the Templar's ruin, since
 he is the one who created it. Go now-- he will know you speak the truth when
 you say I have sent you. Little can be hidden from Morukai's piercing gaze."

<P>Ancient Darkwood Tree, Portal
<BR>
    The inside of the darkwood tree is much like the outside, with coal- black
bark walls as hard as iron. Softly glowing globes affixed to the walls cast a
pale blue-white radiance that gives the inside of the tree a ghostly
appearance. A swirling portal the same spectral hue as the globes spins
silently in the western wall.

Mystical Chambers
<BR>
    This large room in the darkwood tree is furnished with elaborately crafted
furniture, so intricately engraved that it seems unable to support any weight.
Bookshelves lining the walls are filled with thick tomes, many of which appear
incredibly ancient. A large desk stands in the centre of the room, and has an
array of odd, otherlandish objects adorning it. A sense of crackling power
fills the chamber, bringing with it a feeling of awe.

[HP=389/MA=334]:gr morukai

Morukai arches an eyebrow as you address him, but does not rise from his desk.
In a quiet, precise voice, he says, "Evidently you are here on a mission of
some importance. No one who has my favour would entrust the charm of passage
to someone whose need is not great, and few would willingly come here. Speak
now, and remember that little is hidden from me. Lies will annoy me, and those

<BR>
<BR>
You speak to Morukai about the Phoenix prophecy, and Orfeo's tale.
<BR>
<BR>
"Long years have passed since the great war. Often I have thought of the
 Phoenix and her legacy, and the countless cities burned to the ground as the
 Dark One's armies raged in their merciless war. Little pity do I have for
 those of mortal race-- it is their destiny to fight and die, their years are
 short-- but the ravages of the Lord of Shadows go against the laws of this
 realm and cannot be tolerated. I had hope that with the Phoenix egg beyond his
 grasp, and his armies strewn and disordered across the world, that he might
 slumber forever in failure. I see now that I was wrong to entomb the egg, and
 have only postponed the inevitable. If you seek to unravel the Phoenix's
 prophecy, you must undo the barrier I have wrought."
<BR>
<BR>
"The ward may only be undone by my magic, but I have played my part in the
 creation of a new age, and may not participate in this one directly. I may,
 however, aid you somewhat by making an item to dispel the barrier. It will be
 your task to gather the components necessary for me to craft this item, and
 you may have to travel far."
<BR>
<BR>
[HP=389/MA=334]:ask m barrier
<BR>
"Four things I require to fashion the tool you need: double-terminated quartz
 for its shape-- a quartz rod will be its form. Acid glands from a white jelly,
 to act as a catalyst. The cave-burrowing roots of the Peretheln tree, which
 grows only atop a certain hill in the Dragon's Teeth. These will act as a
 binding agent. And last, the unfertilized eggs of a queen ant, from which I
 will drain the fluids to use as a power enhancer. Then using lost magics which
 only I still remember, I will craft this quartz rod and bind the ingredients
 into a powerful spell which can destroy the barrier. When you have obtained
 these four components, return them to me. You may leave
 this tower through the portal in the eastern room of this floor, and may enter
 here directly via the portal on the first floor. Only those who are uninvited
 must survive the other rigors of the tower."

With a slight smile, the great mage takes the four components from you. Giving
you an approving nod, he says:
<BR>
<BR>
"Well done. Now, you must leave me to complete the spell, and imbue the quartz
 rod with the necessary power to destroy the barrier. Return to claim the rod
 in a short while, and I should be done with my work."

"Take it," he says, "and use it well. Remember that your task is not yet
 complete, that destruction of the barrier is but part of it. You must still
 slay the necromancer who stole the egg, and who is still trapped there. Once
 you have recovered the Phoenix's egg, you must return here, and then I will
 give you the last piece of information you need."

Morukai looks up at your approach.

You proudly take out the golden egg, and hand it to the arcane mage. Rolling
the egg about in his hand, Morukai smiles, and says:
<BR>
<BR>
"Excellent. I had some doubts that you would succeed, but indeed you have
 proven yourself worthy. Now you must prepare for the final stage of your
 quest-- resurrecting the Phoenix so that her influence may restore the
 balance that her capture had destroyed. To do this, you must take the egg to
 a place where this realm and the plane of fire meet. Here, and only here, may
 the Phoenix be resurrected. Such a place I sometimes use for various other
 reasons, and I may direct you to it. Down beneath the undercaverns of
 Silvermere, there is a fiery plain where lava seeps in from below. At the
 northern edge of this plain, there is a sealed doorway, which only I may
 open. You must go there, and hurl the egg into the lake of fire which lies
 beyond the door. Then your quest will be finished. Take this key, and make
 haste!"
<BR>
<BR>
He presses a key into your hand, and bids you leave.

<BR>
 -- Following your Party leader north --
<BR>
Lake of Fire
<BR>
    An incredible blazing lake of magma stretches out as far as the eye can see
here. A wide stone ledge at the southern end of this cavern is the only place
on which to stand. Under normal circumstances anyone standing here would be
instantly incinerated by the intense heat, but for some reason it is no warmer
than a pleasant summer's day.
<BR>Also here: Spike*.
<BR>Obvious exits: open door south
<BR>[HP=367/MA=297]:
<BR>
Spike is looking around the room.
<BR>[HP=367/MA=297]:hurl egg
<BR>
You grasp the golden egg firmly, and hurl it out over the lake of fire with all
of your might. As it plunges towards the lake's burning surface, the egg begins
to glow with a flickering white aura. Striking the fiery magma, it explodes in
a flash of golden light!
<BR>
<BR>
Out the burning lake streaks forth an achingly beautiful form, as brilliant as
the stars and swift as the wind. Flying up out of the flames, the Phoenix,
reborn, lands on the edge of the ledge. With a gaze both tender and terrible,
you suddenly understand the legendary creature's thoughts-- that you have the
thanks and everlasting friendship of this beautiful being, and that you will
never be forgotten for your service.
<BR>
<BR>
With a flashing leap, the Phoenix surges into the air once more, circling over
you slowly. A glowing, fluttering object-- a feather-- floats down from her
wing and lands at your feet, and then, abruptly, she is gone in a streak of
flame.
<BR>
