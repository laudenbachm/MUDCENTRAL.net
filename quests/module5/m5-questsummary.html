<TR><TD><B><OL START=1 COMPACT><LI>Go to Rhudaur and locate the Asylum.
<B><LI>Enter a portal in the Asylum.  It is a warped area. Going one way does not mean you will come back the same way.
<B><LI>Locate the Old Man.  Ask him everything that is Highlighted. Ask the Old Man about Prophecy.  (It isn't highlighted, but
 if you don't do that, then you can't start the quest... I think that is a bug in the game.)
<B><LI>Exit the game, come back into the game.  Go South, then West. You'll be outside of the Asylum now.  (This works just like
 in the Mirrored Hallway.)
<B><LI>Go to the Thieve's Guild. Purchase a Skeleton Key. 
<B><LI>Go to the Dump and GO MANHOLE.  You're now in the Sewers.
<B><LI>Located the Dread Mystic.  Kill him.  You will get a Yellow Note.
<B><LI>Locate the Flesh Golem.  Kill him.  You will get a key to open the door there.
<B><LI>Go into the Library and read the scroll (or parchment).
<B><LI>Go to the Silvermere Docks.  West a couple rooms.  Search for a down exit.
<B><LI>Locate the Smuggler Boss (beware the trap near the entrance). Kill him.  You will get a Smuged Paper.
<B><LI>Go to Orfeo and ask him about Morukai.
<B><LI>Go to the Darkwood Grove and locate the Twisted Tree. Go Portal there and you'll be in the Caves of Chaos.
 Locate the Up in there (this place is a bunch of warps like the Vortex). You will need to circle around to the top of the Staircase.
 (quick method:  From the Down, go clockwise 4 times, then east, west, east, west, east).<BR>
 Go South through a door that is not there. (similar to the Fallen Angel) <BR>
 Turn Statue.<BR>
 Go North, West, then Counter-Clockwise until you see a new exit to the South.<BR>
 Go Up (x8) then north, west.  Greet Morukai and ask him about Orfeo.<BR>
 Ask him about the stuff that is highlighted.
<B><LI>Find the four components.<BR>
Eggs:  Located below the Tilled Fields in the Gnome Village.<BR>
Quartz:  Located in the Bandit Keep near Aldreth's Tree.  At the door, search North for a secret passage.  Go Tree and you'll be inside the keep.<BR>
Roots:  Located past the Jagged Hills in the Dragonteeth Hills.  The Jagged Hills are on the northern side of the Dragonteeth Hills between Silvermere and Passage to the Silver River.<BR>
Acid Glands:  Located below the Mad Wizard.  Kill the White Jelly for it.
<B><LI>Go back to Morukai and ask him about components.  Ask him about Return.
<B><LI>Go to the Gnome Alchemist and ask him about Potion.  Take 1 plat with you for purchase.
<B><LI>Go to the Gnome Inventor and ask him about FORKS.
<B><LI>Go to the Mossy Cave entrance on the Silver River.<BR>Use the potion of levitation there.
<B><LI>Go to the room with rubble and MOVE RUBBLE.
<B><LI>You will need to AIM FORK <direction> to destroy walls here in order to locate the Haunting Spirit. <BR>Type DESTROY BARRIER to use the Magical Rod of Quartz to open up the passage. 
<B><LI>Find the Necromancer beyond the Shimmering Barrier and kill him for the Phoenix Egg. 
<B><LI>Return to Morukai and ask him about INFORMATION.
<B><LI>Go to the Lava Fields and locate the door to the North. Use the Basalt Key to open the door.  Once inside, type HURL EGG.
<B><LI>You have now completed the Module-5 Quest, received 750k experience and a Phoenix Feather that gives 1/0.0AC and is usable by ALL CLASSES and it even acts as a magma amulet talk about a bargain.  (Yes, that means that even YOU, a Witchunter, can use this fabulous neck armour!)
<B><LI>Leo the Quick, Ant Queen, and Smuggler Boss all have 3 hour regen times.
