<p><font color="#4444dd"><strong>Greet Elder</strong></font></p>

<p>The village elder looks up from his meditations as you greet him.

&quot;An outsider, at long last. Precious few strangers do we see here, though
truthfully many more than in the past. Most travelers are either Dwarves,
traveling here solely for trading purposes, or accursed Saracens, who come
to raid and plunder. Thankfully both are rarities. The Dwarves are friendly
enough, as long as you are interested in their wares, but the Saracens are
ruthless butchers who follow the fanatical teachings of their relisious
leader without question. It is fortunate that my people are naturally
inclined towards the path of the warrior, for we would have perished long ago
under their onslaught. And thy are the least of our problems.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><font color="#4444dd">Ask Elder Problems</font></strong></p>

<p>&quot;There are problems that go beyond even the raids of the Saracens or the
harshness of the desert. As you undoubtably are unaware of, during the last
age there existed a prosperous land here, ruled by a Pharaoh of great might.
Near the end of the age he became very greedy, and sought to cheat death. As
part of this endless greed he constructed a great pyramid in teh centre of
the realm. As the sandstone quarry ran out, he destroyed whole towns in his
efforts to complete the pyramid. All the while the evil force of his will,
along with the desecration of the land and pillaging of the cities, drained
the land of its life--transforming it into this desert wasteland.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><font color="#4444dd">Ask Elder Saracens</font></strong></p>

<p>&quot;The bloodthirsty Saracens are religious fanatics, who slaughter all who are
not of their faith. They care nothing for life, just for the mindless
propagation of their beliefs. Occasionally we are raided by bands of these
heartless killers, but we have grown wise to their tactics, and now the
are rarely seen around these parts. Dozens of their severed heads placed out
to bake in the sun and be ravaged by scavengers made sure of that. They all
wore these strange amulets...I'll sell you one, for a price.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><font color="#4444dd">Ask Elder Amulets</font></strong></p>

<p>&quot;You are interested in one of the Saracen Amulets?&quot;

The nekojin elder takes your money and hands you a heavy copper amulet.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#4444dd">Ask Elder Pyramid</font></strong></p>

<p>&quot;The pharaoh succeeded in his quest to complete the construction of the
pyramid, though it cost the people of the land greatly. But to their mystery,
the expected reign of terror did not come. Silently, and without warning, th pharaoh
vanished, as did all entrances to the
pyramid. Many speculate on
what actually happened, but i surmise that some great force sealed the
reckless pharaoh in his own citadel of power. He may even be there now,
his black hatred growing stronger over the centuries. This is one of the
things that worries me-- lately strange dark clouds have been converging
over the pyramid. Also, the desert traders, who have a stronghold
nearby the pyramid, say that their trading has been disrupted by increased
monster activity.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><font color="#4444dd">Ask Elder Traders</font></strong></p>

<p>&quot;The traders have a stronghold a short way east of the great pyramid. It would
be an excellent place to begin looking for answers, as they would receive the best
and most accurate gossip in teh region. I have even heard the leader of these
traders has a Seeress who advises him in his business activities. You would
be wise to seek their aid.&quot;</p>
