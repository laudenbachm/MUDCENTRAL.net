<BR>
huge fungus creature
This hulking creature appears to be part beast, part fungus... it is humanoid,
with a jutting head, long arms and stumpy legs. Vicious talons spring from its
fingertips. It is covered with a thick layer of all manner of fungus, and it
is hard to tell if it is even alive. 
<BR>
It appears to be unwounded.

<BR>
Giant Mushroom
<BR>
    The inside of the giant mushroom is covered with a reed-like plant, which
makes up the walls, floor and ceiling. It is surprisingly strong and light.
Various pieces of wooden artwork, mostly abstract carvings, are arranged
around the centre of the chamber, where an opening in the floor gapes.

<BR>
Gloomy Temple
<BR>
    This circular, subterranean chamber is quite large, spanning at least
thirty feet across. It is bare for the most part, its smooth stone walls
lacking any ornamentation whatsoever. In the centre of the room, a dull iron
disc around ten feet in diameter acts as a base for a large, complex sculpture
of stone. Strange runes have been etched in the side of the sculpture, and
multicoloured crystals imbedded within it pulse with a strange rhythm. 
<BR>
Also here: gaunt one temple master.
<BR>
Obvious exits: up
<BR>
[HP=193/MA=215]:set warn on
<BR>
You will now be warned and stopped from doing most evil actions.

[HP=193/MA=215]:ask gau
<BR>
The temple master lifts his head at your approach. With the intense,
knowledgeable gaze of a Gaunt One ancient, he carefully scans you up and
down. In a deep voice that does not echo, he intones:
<BR>
<BR>
"Forbidden are these hallowed halls to those not yet mature. State thy
 business here, fledgeling."
<BR>
<BR>
[HP=197/MA=215]:ask gau business
<BR>
"Only those mature members of the holy race have reason to be here."
<BR>
<BR>
"Since you apparently have advanced far enough to stand with other adults of
 the holy race, you have earned your birthright. Step forward into the 
 Focus."
<BR>
<BR>
With a little hesitation, you slowly walk to the centre of the room. The 
hollow in the centre of the sculpture seems to beckon to you, the glowing
crystals pulsing with an urgent light. As you slip into the hollow, you feel
a slight tingling wash over you.
<BR>
<BR>
Chanting the ancient Song of Seeing, the temple master circles the Focus with
an even pace. Crooning his monotonous chant, he begins to weave an intricate
spell that seems to be part magic, and part... something else. The strength
of his voice rises, as does the power of the pulsing lights.
<BR>
<BR>
After a few minutes, the master's voice is reverberating in your skull like
thunder, and the light is flashing like lightning. Abruptly, with a brilliant
stroke, the light flares out, leaving you dazed!
<BR>
<BR>
You stumble out of the Focus, your vision slowly beginning to clear. With a
heavy hand, the temple master grips you by the shoulders, speaking softly and
saying:
<BR>
<BR>
"Go now, as a mature member of our race. One of the chosen of the holy ones.
 And know that your place in the Circle is assured, when the time comes. Go
 in peace, and watchfulness."
