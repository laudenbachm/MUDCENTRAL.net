Crypt, Shadowed Hall

    This hall is carved out of a translucent white stone, its walls engraved

with strangely vivid scenes of a huge battle. Rows of mounted knights, their

lance-points gleaming, ride against a horrific demonic horde in this image. A

heroic, plate-clad paladin and a tall, shrouded figure stand like generals on

opposite sides in every scene. Indecipherable runes are carved over the arches

to the east and west.

hanging from the ceiling. Its curving wall is broken by four identical

passages, each arrowing off into the darkness.

Marble Passage

    This narrow passageway is made of smooth white marble, polished to a

mirrorlike shine. Your every sound echoes down its length like a thunderclap,

it is so silent here. The passage slopes downwards at a steady angle, heading

into the bowels of the earth.

mystic spirit

This is image of a well-built half-orc, wearing nothing but a loose pair of

white pants. He stands in such a manner as to suggest that if you blinked your

eyes, he could be upon you before they opened again. Despite his forbidding

appearance, he gives you a toothy grin. 

He appears to be unwounded.

[HP=75/KAI=9]:ask my

The mystic spirit greets you with a bow, saying "Welcome young one. Thy 

travels have brought thee far, to find me in this cursed tomb where I am 

bound. The dark one was cruel indeed to keep my spirit in this plane after we 

were vanquished, but even in defeat there can be hope. I have little left to 

offer, save my experiences fighting the unnamed one. My skill is thine to 

learn from, and I would gladly train thee to the next level of advancement. 

One more thing can I offer you: seek the old one in the heart of the 

darkenwood, he alone lived through the Great Wars, and he alone has mastery 

enough to provide thee with the necessary learning you shall surely need in 

the future."
