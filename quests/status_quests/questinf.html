<P>

The mystic spirit greets you with a bow, saying "Welcome young one. Thy

travels have brought thee far, to find me in this cursed tomb where a am

bound. The dark one was cruel indeed to keep my spirit in this plane

after we were vanquished, but even in defeat there can be hope. I have

little left to offer, save my experiences fighting the unnamed one. My

skill is thine to learn from, and I would gladly train thee to the next

level of advancement. One more thing can I offer you: seek the old one

in the heart of the darkenwood, he alone lived through the Great Wars,

and he alone has mastery enough to provide thee with the necessary

learning you shall surely need in the future."
<P>
young girl
<P>

This dark-haired girl is clad in the white embroidered robes of a temple

priest, though she looks far too young to hold such a position. Her wide

blue eyes seem to hold much wisdom in them, and more than a little

secrecy.
<P>

The young girl smiles at you, saying "Thank you, brave one. I would

surely have been slain had you not arrived in time. You have earned the

right to proceed further. Turn the right candle to your left, and the

path shall be revealed to you."
<P>
mystic spirit
<P>
This is image of a well-built half-orc, wearing nothing but a loose pair

of white pants. He stands in such a manner as to suggest that if you

blinked your eyes, he could be upon you before they opened again.

Despite his forbidding appearance, he gives you a toothy grin.
<P>
clawed gloves
<P>
These heavy gloves are made out of stiff cloth, and have three steel

claws each jutting off of their backs. They are used by mystics to

increase their hand to hand damage.
<P>
priest spirit
<P>
Before you stands the image of a tall, white-robed man, his hair greying

with age. His bright green eyes seem to pierce through the insubstantial

haze surrounding him, and his commanding personality gives him an almost

regal demeanor.
<P>
platinum mace
<P>
This well-balanced mace has a round head made out of reinforced platinum,

with a shaft of black iron. Its head is inscribed with holy symbols, and

there is a powerful aura of power surrounding it.
<P>
ninja spirit
<P>
Before you stands a tall, lean half-orc, wearing full black ninja armour.

Twin short swords swing by his side, and his hood is pulled low over his

eyes. Despite his unsettling appearance, he manages a short bow at your

approach, and motions you closer.
<P>
ebony ninjato
<P>
This straight singled-edged blade is made out of some strange black

metal. Its hilt is forged into the shape of a black pantherm with

glowing amber stones for eyes.
<P>
{Warlock spirit needed! Email to: veggie@socalonramp.com}
<P>
flametounge
<P>
This long, needle-pointed blade is made of shining high steel. Its hilt

is carved obsidian, and is inlayed with small rubies. When drawn, the

blade bursts into flame, burning those who it hits.
<P>
mage spirit
<P>
Before you stands the shadowed image of a black-shrouded dark elf. His

bright blue eyes peer from the depths of his hood, and as he looks you

up and down, he seems to nod to himself in satisfaction.
<P>
obsidian runestaff
<P>
This is a six-foot-long staff of a glossy jet black substance. Its

surface is heavily carved with swirling runes which seem to pulse and

glow redly with an inner light.
<P>
bard spirit
<P>
The transparent image of a half-elven bard stands before you. She wears

bright red silks, and carries a golden harp in her hands.
<P>
jewelled main gauche
<P>
This long-bladed knife is meant to be wielded in the left hand as a

defensive weapon. It has a wide guard and strong blade, which allow it

to turn aside most weapons. It is quite ornate, and an eye-sized ruby is

set in its pommel.
<P>
witchunter spirit
<P>
The image of a mammoth, mailed half-ogre floats before you. His huge

greatsword hangs from its side as if it were a one-handed blade.  At

your approach, he looks you up and down with a surprising intelligent

gaze.
<P>
mithril cutlass
<P>
This three foot long blade is crafted out of the finest metal known --

mithril. It blade is so keen it could cut a hair, and its balance is

perfect. Its slightly curved blade can slice through steel and flesh

with equal ease.
<P>
thief spirit
<P>
The image of a halfling wavers before you. He wears soft leather clothing, and

a shortsword swings by his side. As you approach, he grins and gives a little

bow in welcoming. 
<br>
The thief spirit greets you with a bow, saying "Welcome young one. Thy 

travels have brought thee far, to find me in this cursed tomb where I am 

bound. The dark one was cruel indeed to keep my spirit in this plane after we 

were vanquished, but even in defeat there can be hope. I have little left to 

offer, save my experiences fighting the unnamed one. My skill is thine to 

learn from, and I would gladly train thee to the next level of advancement. 

One more thing can I offer you: seek the old one in the heart of the 

darkenwood, he alone lived through the Great Wars, and he alone has mastery 

enough to provide thee with the necessary learning you shall surely need in 

the future."
<P>
crystal shortsword
<P>
This razor-edged blade is made of chiseled green crystal. Its hilt is

crafted out of black steel, and is bound with silver cord.
<P>
ranger spirit
<P>
Before you stands the image of a leather-clad elf, shrouded in a cloak

which makes her nearly invisible. A long blade and ash bow hang from her

back. Her long blonde hair is done up into many small braids which

cascade down her shoulders, and she looks you over cooly.
<P>
witchwood spear
<P>
This spear is crafted from a magically-grown hardwood, which when cut

from the living tree, can be crafted into high quality magical weapons.

This long spear is inlaid with silvery runes, and its foot-long bladed

head narrows to a razor-sharp point.
<P>
paladin spirit
<P>
A shimmering image of a tall man wearing full plate armour stands before

you. He rests his hands on the pommel of his great sword, and though you

cannot see his face through his visored helm, he seems to exude an aura

of quiet sorrow.
<P>
shimmering longsword
<P>
This exquisite silvery longsword is polished to a mirrorlike sheen. Its

hilt is wrapped in cords of gold, and is heavily worked with holy

symbols.
<P>
missionary spirit
<P>
An image of a lithe human woman stands before you. She is clad in dark

leather armour, and wields a peculiar curved blade. Her shoulder length

red hair flutters like a cloud around her, and her clear grey eyes hold

your unwaveringly.
<P>
jewelled scimitar
<P>
This elaborately worked scimitar is made of the finest high steel, and

is worked with many exquisite gems. Its hand guard is delicately worked

to portray a snake biting its own tail.
<P>
cleric spirit
<P>
The image of a short, stocky dwarf clad in shining mail and bearing a

massive warhammer stands before you. The dwarf's fierce grin can be seen

through his winged helm, and as you approach he raises a mailed fist in

greeting.
<P>
black flail
<P>
This large, jet-black flail has glowing red runes burning along its

length. Its three heads are spiked and would cause great damage in

battle.
<P>
warrior spirit
<P>
Before you stands the shimmering figure of a kang warrior, amoured in

glittering plate mail. Twin broadswords hang from his back, and as you

look him up and down, he bows slightly. With a shock, you recognize him

as one of the old heroes of silvermere
<P>
golden battleaxe
<P>
This heavy, double-bladed hand axe appears to be made of a glittering

gold. Its razor-sharp blade gleams in the light, illuminating the

miniscule runes covering its surface.
<P>
druid spirit
<P>
Before you stands the image of a grey-cloaked druid leaning upon a

nightblack staff. His piercing grey eyes seem to penetrate your mind,

and he looks as if he is evaluating you as the merchants examine

livestock.
<P>
darkwood staff
<P>
This is a living branch from a darkwood tree. It is warm to the touch,

and you can feel the lifeblood flowing withing. A silver sheath caps

the bottom of the staff, and the centre is carved with intricate looping

designs to provide good grip.
<P>
gypsy spirit
<P>
Before you stands the image of a goblin, dressed in brightly coloured

clothes and bearing a broadsword across its back. He grins easily as you

approach, and with an elaborate flourish, bows in greeting.
<P>
silver rapier
<P>
This light sword has a long, thin blade designed for thrusting, which

shines with a soft white light. It handles beautifully, and it seems to

move with a will of its own.
