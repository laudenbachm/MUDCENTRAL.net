<p>Dan's NOTE: On our second "PVP free-for-all" day at Cybercity, where MUD gets backed up for a few 
hours and anything goes, a group of us rerolled our characters to L10 Paladins and Missionaries 
and took on the horned demon.  Baby is my L40 Paladin Sir, rerolled to a wimpy L10 Paladin ;-) 
Let the massacre begin!</p>
