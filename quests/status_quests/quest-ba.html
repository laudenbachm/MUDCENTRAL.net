Crypt, Sealed Tomb

    Unlit torches line the walls of this ten foot wide stone hallway. The floor

is lined with engraved tiles, and the walls are apparently seamless. Your

footfall echoes hollowly through this unsettling passage, and you get the

impression that you are being watched. There is a large stone door in the

northern wall, and set in the centre of it is a small black keyhole. 

You notice bone key here.

Also here: Towser, Caramon, mummy.

Obvious exits: closed door north, south

 [HP=69/MA=41]:Towser says "hey i was handling it"

 [HP=69/MA=41]:mummy

This seven foot tall humanoid monstrosity is completely shrouded in filthy,

yellowed burial wrappings. Its every movement is made with slow deliberation,

and it reeks of decay and tomb rot, forcing you to turn your head to avoid the

fumes. 

It appears to be very critically wounded.

 [HP=69/MA=41]:Caramon fires a lightning bolt at mummy for 29 damage!

 [HP=69/MA=41]:The mummy's wrapping unravels, revealing nothing but dust.

Crypt, Shadowed Hall

    This hall is carved out of a translucent white stone, its walls engraved

with strangely vivid scenes of a huge battle. Rows of mounted knights, their

lance-points gleaming, ride against a horrific demonic horde in this image. A

heroic, plate-clad paladin and a tall, shrouded figure stand like generals on

opposite sides in every scene. Indecipherable runes are carved over the arches

to the east and west, and there is a large stone door to the south. 

Also here: Caramon.

Obvious exits: north, open door south, east, west

owlbear

This huge, ponderous creature appears to be some sort of cross between a bear

and a bird -- it has a massive, furred body, and the head and beak of an

oversized owl. Although it looks extremely powerful, it does not appear too

quick or perceptive. 

It appears to be heavily wounded.

 [HP=71/MA=44]:look jewe

This long-bladed knife is meant to be wielded in the left hand as a defensive

weapon. It has a wide guard and strong blade, which allow it to turn aside most

weapons. It is quite ornate, and an eye-sized ruby is set in its pommel.

The bard spirit greets you with a bow, saying "Welcome young one. Thy 

travels have brought thee far, to find me in this cursed tomb where I am 

bound. The dark one was cruel indeed to keep my spirit in this plane after we 

were vanquished, but even in defeat there can be hope. I have little left to 

offer, save my experiences fighting the unnamed one. My skill is thine to 

learn from, and I would gladly train thee to the next level of advancement. 

One more thing can I offer you: seek the old one in the heart of the 

darkenwood, he alone lived through the Great Wars, and he alone has mastery 

enough to provide thee with the necessary learning you shall surely need in 

the future."
