even in defeat there can be hope. I have little left to offer, save my experiences 
fighting the unnamed one. My skill is thine to learn from, and I would gladly train 
thee to the next level of advancement. One more thing can I offer you: seek the old 
one in the heart of the darkenwood, he alone lived through the Great Wars, and he 
alone has mastery enough to provide thee with the necessary learning you shall surely 
need in the future."
