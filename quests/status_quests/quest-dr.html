travels have brought thee far, to find me in this cursed tomb where I am 

bound. The dark one was cruel indeed to keep my spirit in this plane after we 

were vanquished, but even in defeat there can be hope. I have little left to 

offer, save my experiences fighting the unnamed one. My skill is thine to 

learn from, and I would gladly train thee to the next level of advancement. 

One more thing can I offer you: seek the old one in the heart of the 

darkenwood, he alone lived through the Great Wars, and he alone has mastery 

enough to provide thee with the necessary learning you shall surely need in 

the future."
