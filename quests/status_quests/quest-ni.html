the far corner. Broken and splintered bones are strewn about at random, nearly

    This cavernous chamber's walls are covered with hundreds of intricate

frescoes depicting the turbulent history of Silvermere. The Heroes of

unnamed one. A mammoth stone sarcophagus rests on the floor in the centre of

the chamber, and a small altar stands at its feet. There is a shimmering blue

portal in the far wall.

You bow to rogue spirit.

[HP=58]:ask rogue

The rogue spirit greets you with a bow, saying "Welcome young one. Thy

travels have brought thee far, to find me in this cursed tomb where I am

bound. The dark one was cruel indeed to keep my spirit in this plane after we

were vanquished, but even in defeat there can be hope. I have little left to

offer, save my experiences fighting the unnamed one. My skill is thine to

learn from, and I would gladly train thee to the next level of advancement.

One more thing can I offer you: seek the old one in the heart of the

darkenwood, he alone lived through the Great Wars, and he alone has mastery

enough to provide thee with the necessary learning you shall surely need in

the future."

[HP=58]:get eb

You took ebony ninjato.

[HP=58]:l eb

This straight singled-edged blade is made out of some strange black metal. Its

hilt is forged into the shape of a black pantherm with glowing amber stones for

eyes.

[HP=60]:wear eb

You are now holding ebony ninjato.

[HP=60]:l ro

rogue spirit

Before you stands a tall, lean half-orc, wearing full black ninja armour. Twin

short swords swing by his side, and his hood is pulled low over his eyes.

Despite his unsettling appearance, he manages a short bow at your approach, and

motions you closer.

He appears to be unwounded.

[HP=60]:go portal

You step through the shimmering portal.

The Ninja Quest is not very difficult (if the regeneration hasn't gotten

outta hand and there are more than 4 monsters in each room). The entrance

is what I call a "Safe Room". Any time you get too low in Hit Points, you

can run there to rest (and the monsters won't follow you in there).

The Owlbear is not difficult, it is about the equivelent of 2 half-ogre

bodyguards. Good luck -Queeg
