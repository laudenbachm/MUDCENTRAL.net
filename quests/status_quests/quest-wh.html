Crypt, Sealed Tomb

    Unlit torches line the walls of this ten foot wide stone hallway. The floor

is lined with engraved tiles, and the walls are apparently seamless. Your

footfall echoes hollowly through this unsettling passage, and you get the

impression that you are being watched. There is a large stone door in the

northern wall, and set in the centre of it is a small black keyhole.

Also here: fierce mummy.

with strangely vivid scenes of a huge battle. Rows of mounted knights, their

opposite sides in every scene. Indecipherable runes are carved over the arches

to the east and west.
