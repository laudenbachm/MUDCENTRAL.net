This hideous beast is about twice the size of a large bull. Its four scaly legs

Large Tomb

    This cavernous chamber's walls are covered with hundreds of intricate

frescoes depicting the turbulent history of Silvermere. The Heroes of

Silvermere can clearly be seen battling against the demonic forces of the

unnamed one. A mammoth stone sarcophagus rests on the floor in the centre of

the chamber, and a small altar stands at its feet. There is a shimmering blue

portal in the far wall.

frescoes depicting the turbulent history of Silvermere. The Heroes of

Silvermere can clearly be seen battling against the demonic forces of the

unnamed one. A mammoth stone sarcophagus rests on the floor in the centre of

[HP=32/MA=36]:go portal

You step through the shimmering portal.

Graveyard, Tomb Entrance

    You are standing on a path in the middle of the graveyard of Silvermere.

Headstones line the path to either side, vanishing into the opalescent white

mist shrouding the area. Clammy tendrils of this shimmering mist curl around

your ankles, chilling you to the bone, and the mournful howl of the wind makes

you uneasy. A massive stone tomb stands to the north, its carved doors shut

tight. There is a distinct foreboding aura about the tomb. 

Obvious exits: closed door north, south, east, west
