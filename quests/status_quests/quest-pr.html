Crypt, Sealed Tomb

    Unlit torches line the walls of this ten foot wide stone hallway. The floor

is lined with engraved tiles, and the walls are apparently seamless. Your

footfall echoes hollowly through this unsettling passage, and you get the

impression that you are being watched. There is a large stone door in the

northern wall, and set in the centre of it is a small black keyhole.

Crypt, Shadowed Hall

    This hall is carved out of a translucent white stone, its walls engraved

with strangely vivid scenes of a huge battle. Rows of mounted knights, their

lance-points gleaming, ride against a horrific demonic horde in this image. A

heroic, plate-clad paladin and a tall, shrouded figure stand like generals on

opposite sides in every scene. Indecipherable runes are carved over the arches

to the east and west, and there is a large stone door to the south.

bound. The dark one was cruel indeed to keep my spirit in this plane after we 

were vanquished, but even in defeat there can be hope. I have little left to 

offer, save my experiences fighting the unnamed one. My skill is thine to 

learn from, and I would gladly train thee to the next level of advancement. 

One more thing can I offer you: seek the old one in the heart of the 

darkenwood, he alone lived through the Great Wars, and he alone has mastery 

enough to provide thee with the necessary learning you shall surely need in 

the future."

Graveyard, Tomb Entrance

    You are standing on a path in the middle of the graveyard of Silvermere.

Headstones line the path to either side, vanishing into the opalescent white

mist shrouding the area. Clammy tendrils of this shimmering mist curl around

your ankles, chilling you to the bone, and the mournful howl of the wind makes

you uneasy. A massive stone tomb stands to the north, its carved doors shut

tight. There is a distinct foreboding aura about the tomb. 

Also here: fierce zombie.
