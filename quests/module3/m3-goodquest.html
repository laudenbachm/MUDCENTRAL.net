<tr><td><B>
Chancellor Annora smiles warmly at you, clasps your hand and says:
<P>
"Well met, friend! It is a pleasure to once more see your face. Unfortunately,
I wish it was under better circumstances... The forces of darkness are
growing at an almost overwhelming rate now. Legions of black orcs and packs of trolls
have been seen maurauding in the south and east, and even an increase in
dragon sightings has been reported. This is not good news. We need to find
allies, and quickly! This is where you come in. Recently the barrier that
blockaded the road between Silvermere and the dwarven mountain of Khazarad
was destroyed. Although we have long been out of contact with the dwarves there,
once we were on good terms with them, and hope to be once again. Your mission
is to go parlay with the dwarven king, and beseech him to join our cause. It 
is of vital importance that we have the dwarves of Khazarad as our allies--
they are doughty and relentless fighters, as well as being the finest
crafters of arms in this realm. Go now, and may I greet your return with joy for your
success!"
<P>
ask king business
<P>
The dwarven king listens to your tale of Chancellor Annora's plea with keen
interest. When you are done, he sits back for a moment and broods
thoughtfully.
<P>
"Adventurer, " he continues, "it would seem the fates have dropped you in my 
 lap right when aid is needed the most, although I am loathe to admit it. Let
 it never be said that Kulgar was not one to accept aid when it was offered,
 not to refuse it when requested. However, time has grown long in our 
 friendship with Annora's people, and the peoples of Khazarad have their own
 problems."
<P>     
He looks you over appraisingly, seeming to weigh a decision in his head.
<BR>     
"I have made my choice. I will ally my forces with Annora's folk willingly,
 provided one condition is met-- that you aid US in our time of need. I do not
 offer our aid lightly, as the task I would set to you seems an impossible one
 to me. But make your decision now, as only should you choose to accept our
 alliance will I reveal our plight."
<P>         
ask king accept
<P>         
King Kulgar leans forward with a burning hatred in his eyes, and whispers:
<P>         
"DEMONS. Foul abominations from beyond this plane infest our very mines! Only
 the upper levels of the mines remain free of their filth. It has sorely hurt
 our income, as the demons are resistant to most weapons, and are merciless
 when they attack. The normal creatures that lurk in the mines, we have little
 trouble with-- the dwarves of Khazarad are mighty warriors. But these hellish
 creatures scoff at plain iron, as it glances off of them like rain off of a
 duck's back. It is a troubling problem. Many of our finest fighters have been
 slain, their bodies defiled and consumed. It is an outrage!"
<P>                
He sits back with a disgusted look on his face. After a moment, he seems to
 compose himself, and goes on:
<P>                
"Even my champion, the legendary hero Gudruk, was finally defeated. He lies
 now in the temple, recovering from his wounds. I know little of it other than
 that he confronted some hellish beast from beyond,and even his mighty mithril axe
 could not faze it, though the lesser demons were cut like wheat upon it. You
 should talk with him, as his experiences might prove invaluable. Another that
 may aid you would be Loremaster Thulgraf, my sage and historian. His chambers
 are down the stairs, and south of the golden doors. May you succeed in your
 quest, wanderer, and return to me with a tale of glorious victory!"
<P>                       
Also here: Loremaster Thulgraf.
<BR>
 Obvious exits: open door south, east
<BR>
 greet lore
<P>
 This ancient dwarf is deeply enraptured by a book he is reading when you hail
 him. After a moment, as if shaking off a heavy sleep, he looks up, notices
 you, and exclaims:
<P>                       
"Ahh, strangers come to the halls of lore! Greetings, and please help 
 yourselves to the vast library of information I have accumulated here. It is
 unparalled!"
<BR>                        
With a sudden start of surprise, he seems to remember something. In a voice
 that would be funny if it were not apparent he is trying to be stern, says:
<BR>                         
"Errm, hrmph, I mean, of course, do you have permission from the King to be
 here? I cannot answer questions nor help you if you don't have official
 reason to request my aid. A matter of law, you know."
<P>                           
ask lore permission
<P>
Before you even have a chance to finish your statement, he blurts out:
<BR>
"Yes yes, very good, I knew you would be here on official business."
<P>
You wonder how he knew such a thing, but before you can ask, he speaks:
<BR>
"It is about time someone took the time to talk to me! I mean, this whole 
 problem probably could have been avoided had someone listened to my advice. 
 The king considers me a senile old fool, and though I must admit I am prone
 to rambling sometimes, there are things I see and read that no one else has the
 patience to discover! For example, just last week I found a priceless formula
 for curing a most troublesome problem that afflicts the warriors here-- Yellow
 Foot. It is a fungus that causes the feet to stink quite awfully, creating
 tension in the barracks and making one be embarrased by the smell wherever
 one goes. The cure is to obtain a smooth chunk of crystal, and to treat it with a
 soltuion of Limestone Powder, Slug Tongue and..."
<P> 
When he sees your eyes glazing over in boredom, he clears his throat and 
 continues:
<BR>                                    
"Hrm. Ah, yes, well I assume you are not here to defeat the evils of Yellow 
 Foot disease. What was I going to say again? Ahh yes, the problem in the 
 mines. To make a long story short, I knew this was going to happen. It was
 propecised in the Book of Koll, an ancient dwarven manuscript that few sages
 nowadays have the skills to decipher. I of course have no such problem, and
 while poring through its pages I happened upon a short passage, that told 
 about a horrible scourge that was entombed deep below the mountain. It was 
 held in a massive blue gem, that sparkled unlike any other stone ever 
 discovered. Well, it was buried in the lowest mine for a reason, and that is
 what I told the king when I heard he was authorizing deeper mines to be dug.
 Of course I was not listened to, and that's why you're here now. The demons
 have been set loose."
<P>                                               
ask lore demons
<P>                                               
He sits back in his chair, steeples his fingers and begins to lecture:
<BR>                                               
"According to the ancient text, the demons can only be slain by special
 weapons. Normal ones will not even scratch them, and the longer they stay in
 this plane, the more resistant they become. In addition, their leader is
 completely impervious to any metal from this world! He is the key to removing
 their presence, as he keeps open the portal that was created with the
 breaking of the gem. It appears an arcane ritual must be followed to forge a unique
 weapon, the only thing that can harm this hellish creature: the Spirit Dagger
 of Goijar. I won't tell you what the prophecy says in its entirety, as the 
 text is two-hundred pages long and we would likely be overrun by the time I
 was finished. In short, you must find a material to craft the physical form
 of the dagger. The metal you must find cannot come from this world-- thankfully
 I can help you with that. I have observed a strange comet that struck down in
 the Dragon's Teeth hills like a fireball. It displayed some odd properties
 that have led me to find that it contains the material you seek. Then you
 must get it forged into a weapon, and this is the easy part, as the master smith
 Martok is the finest weaponsmith in this part of the world. Ask him to forge
 a weapon with the metal once you have found it. However, this weapon alone will
 not be enough to harm the greater demon-- there are magical and spiritual
 components as well. These, however, I have no knowledge of. I know that there
 is an aging enchantress in the village of the gnomes who may aid you: seek
 her out, it may be that she will provide you with the rest of the information." 
<P> 
Also here: Champion Gudruk, happy dwarven cleric, dwarven cleric.
<BR>
greet gudruk
<P>                                                                   
The massive dwarven hero props himself on one elbow, and leans over the edge
 of the bed. With a small grimace of pain, he says:
<BR> 
"God's breath and bones, these bandages will be the death of me. I can barely
 move an inch without feeling like a trussed-up banquet pig! Ahh, never the 
 worry though. I've recovered from worse."
<P> 
With that, he winks and breaks out in a broad grin. 
<BR>                                                                     
"Now what have you come to visit me for? I don't remember meeting any
 strangers of late, but then again, I did take a nasty blow to the head."
<P>                                                                      
ask gudruk demon
<P>
Gudruk looks at you strangely. When you mention your talk with king Kulgar, he nods and whispers:
<P>
"Aye, aye, indeed I know some about the foul plague of demons lurking in our
 lowest and most precious mines. There's a general order to keep things quiet,
 which is why I didn't mention anything earlier. But since you've agreed to 
 help us, I'll tell you what I know."
<BR>
 "I suppose it all started when one of our miners stumbled upon a massive,
 glittering gem of the purest blue embedded in the mine wall deep down in the
 mithril mines. Naturally, great efforts were undertaken to loosen it from the
 wall's grasp, but it did not come. Finally, under the incredible pressures
 we applied, it cracked. A brilliant blue light flashed out, and a thunderclap
 made us all reel in pain. From the shards of the gem smoked out a wispy mist,
 which began to spin and whirl in a vortex. After a moment, it had formed a
 sort of oval disc about ten feet tall. Much to our surprise, a minute later a
 horrible nightmare creature stepped out of it! The rest, as they say, is 
 history. More of the demonic beasts poured out of the portal, and more
 dwarves went to fight them. It wasn't going so bad until IT appeared. Massive and 
 hideous beyond all explanation, it was shrouded in an otherworldy darkness
 that brought fear into the hearts of even the strongest warriors. I was the
 only one who could face it, and when I did, even my keen mithril axe was
 turned aside by its demonic skin. Terribly wounded, I nonetheless managed to
 make it back to the upper mines, where I was brought here."
<BR>
 "That greater demon is a scourge to the mountain. I fear that it is waiting 
 down there, accumulating its power so that it can attempt a massive strike to
 wipe out our city. The unreasoning hatred these demons display is unmatched,
 they give no quarter nor do they ask for any. And if my own mithril axe could
 not harm their lord, then I have no hope for what may."
<P> 
ask gud mithril
<P>
"If my axe Bloodbiter could not harm them," he growls, "then I know not what 
 else would avail. You might speak with Master Smith Martok, down in the
 forge, for he knows all about metals and weapons and could perhaps help you."
 Forge of Khazarad
<P> 
Also here: Master Smith Martok, dwarven smith, dwarven smith, fat dwarven
 smith, large dwarven smith, small dwarven smith, happy dwarven smith, happy
 dwarven smith.
<P>
greet martok
<P>
The smith doesn't look up from the glowing iron bar he is furiously pounding
on the black anvil. In a voice like grinding stone, he says:
<P>
"Make yer speech quick, young one, as old Martok has still many more o' these
 t'pound into shape before the day is done."
<P> 
ask martok mithril
<P>
A sparkle gleams in the smith's eye as you mention mithril.
<P>
"Ahh... mithril. Now there be the king of all metals-- harder than steel, soft
 as butter in the hands of a skilled smith, and more beautiful than a star's
 twinkle. Though it be precious beyond reckoning, deadly weapons can be
 fashioned from it, and lordly armour. Jewelry set in mithril is worth ten 
 times its normal value."
<P> 
Hesitantly you interrupt him, and mention your talk with Champion Gudruk.
<P>                                                                                                   
"Ye have talked with Gudruk, eh? Aye, what he say be true, though I would not
 have believed such a thing from a lesser dwarf. His mithril axe, which I 
 myself lovingly forged, glancing uselessly from the demon's hide? It will be
 an unearthly weapon which would harm this beast, I do believe. I regret to
 say that nothing of which I know could be crafted into a weapon for such a
 use."
<P> 
Home of the Enchantress

Also here: gnome enchantress.
<BR>
Obvious exits: open door east
<P>
greet ench
<P>
The elderly gnome woman looks up at you with a piercing gaze. With a throaty
chuckle, she murmurs:
<P>                                                                                                        
"What have you come to me for, then? Do you wish a charm for your sweetie? Or
 perhaps a trinket to ward away mosquitoes? Those are popular around here,
 what with the swamp nearby. Speak up now, I'm a busy woman!"
<P> 
ask gnome demon
<P>
The gnome enchantress looks at you quizically.
<P>
"I see you have talked with King Kulgar. I cannot see any harm in telling you
 what I know, then. These demons come from a mystical portal, that connects
 our world to theirs. Their plain is full of strange, magical energy, that will 
 make them indestructible in our world, given time. The only chance of
 stopping them would be to close the portal, but to do this, the great demon Gugluthra
 must be destroyed. He is the one who keeps the rift open, by the power of his
 magics. Unfortunately, no power I know of can harm nor, nor can any known 
 weapon. It is a sad fact that we may all be dead soon."
<P>
Head on out to the crater in dragon teeth hills and kill the metalic monstrosity. 
Bring the shard he drops back to Khazard.
<P> 
Forge of Khazarad

Also here: big dwarven smith.
<BR>
Obvious exits: north, south, east, west
<P>
ask master forge
<P>
Martok looks at you curiously, asking:
<P>
"What is it ye wish me to forge?"
<P>
You show him the gleaming meteoric shard, and a wondering look lights up hisface. 
 When you tell him the tale that Loremaster Thulgraf gave you, he nodswith a broad 
 grin, and exclaims:"Aye, this would indeed do the trick! I will stop what I'm doing 
 and work on it at once. A dagger ye need, and a dagger ye'll get!"With a blur of
 motion, he tosses the shard in his forge, and gets to work.Clang...Clang...Clang...
 Clang...After a while, he stops working, sweat gleaming from his brow and a triumphant
 look upon his face."There ye go," he says, "it be a fine weapon indeed. 
 A blessing on yer quest, traveler, and godspeed!"
<P>
look dagger 
<P>
This long, straight dagger glitters with an otherworldly bluish hue. It is made
 of a metal unknown to this land, and is both indestructible and razor-sharp. 
<P> 
eq dagger
<P>
You are now holding gleaming dagger.
<P>

<BR>
Also here: Miss, Cole, Berrig, gnome enchantress, dwarven guard, dwarven guard.
<BR>
Obvious exits: open door east
<P>
look enchantress
<P>
This ancient woman is cloaked in a deep blue robe covered in silver symbols.
 She leans heavily upon a golden cane topped with a glittering sapphire, but the
 sparkle in her eye tells of wisdom and intelligence. 
<BR>
 She appears to be unwounded.
<P>
ask enchantress dagger
<P>
The gnome enchantress looks at you quizically.
<P>
"Ahh, you have spoken with Loremaster Thulgraf? A learned dwarf is he, though
prone to being somewhat scatterbrained. Quickly, tell me what he said!"
<P>                                                                                                                  
You waste no time in explaining about the Spirit Dagger of Goijar.
<P>
"Hmm... I have never heard of this dagger, but the process of binding a spirit
to an enchanted object is not unheard of. I believe I could do it, though it
will be greatly taxing. Like the Loremaster said, there are three steps in
creating this dagger: first, you must find a metal not of this world, and have
it forged into a weapon. Second, you must bring this dagger to me, and I must
enchant it with a complex spell of binding. This will allow you to trap a
spirit of great power within the blade, creating the Spirit Dagger of Goijar.
The spirit required for this last step must be a soul of great power, and one
unjustly forced to remain after death in this world against its will. Slaying
it with the enchanted dagger will both trap its life force in the weapon, and
also provide the means for its liberation-- for when the demon Gulgluthra is
slain with the dagger, it will shatter, releasing the trapped spirit to where
it should rightfully be."
<P>
ask enchantress enchant
<P>
The old gnome holds her hand out, saying:
<P>
"So what do ye need me to enchant today?"
<P>
You hand her the gleaming dagger, and a look of admiration comes over her. With
a sigh, she places the dagger on a table, and says:
<P>
"Ahh, old Martok always did have good hands. This masterpiece is perfect for
the spells that must be cast upon it. Now this will only take a moment, but
do not be decieved! It is extremely taxing, and will take a lot out of me."
With that, she turns to the dagger, and begins chanting in a low, mournful
voice. Passing her hands slowly over it in circles, a pale ghostly light begins
to flicker about the weapon. Her voice rising and becoming more forceful, the
gnome enchantress begins to intone arcane words of power! The dagger floats up
in the air, lazily spinning, the spectral glow pulsing like a heartbeat! With
one final shout, the enchantress grasps the dagger, and a blinding flash fills
the room!
Her hands trembling, the old gnome turns to you, the enchanted weapon held out
before her.
<P>
"Take it," she murmurs, "and use it well. Now go, find the spectre you 
need, and destroy it. Then seek out Gulgluthra!"
<P>
look dagger
<P>
This long, straight dagger glitters with an otherworldly bluish hue. It is made
of a metal unknown to this land, and is both indestructible and razor-sharp. 
<P>
eq dagger
<P>
You are now holding enchanted dagger.
<BR>
(Note: now head over to the spectral knight behind the old crypt and wax him with the 
dagger in your inventory or eq'ed it will then turn into the Spirit Dagger of Goijar.
Then head down into the bottom of the mine and beat on Mr Gulgulthra. Once you have
vanquished him go back to the dwarven king and ask him 'return', you will 
get a chest, then go back to Annora and ask her 'success' and she will give you
7.5 Million exp.

Congrates your now finished.
