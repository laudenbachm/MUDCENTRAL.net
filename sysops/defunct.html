  <font color=#ffcc33><B>D - Check for defunct MUD users, etc.</font></b><BR>
During the BETA testing period, one of the features which got left until
the end was the deleting of MajorMUD users when the actual BBS account
was deleted.  This utility will walk through all of the MajorMUD characters
and confirm that the BBS account still exists.  If it doesn't exist, you
will be prompted to delete it (at which point, X will take you out of
the checking).  Note that if you choose to not delete the MajorMUD
character, the next user to login and create an account as that userid
will 'inherit' the MajorMUD character for that userid.
This option has been expanded to include the option to delete MUD players
who have not played for a while, or who do not appear to be really 'playing'
the game.  For these users, you will be prompted to see if you want to
delete the player and you will be shown a bit of information regarding the
amount of time they have spent, experience earned, etc.  If a user has not
played since before either version x or y (I forget which), then you
will see the following in the user description under this option:
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Total time played: 0 minutes<br>
Last played on 00-000-80 (5664 days ago)
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
This is not a bug, it merely indicates that the game does NOT know the
last time they played, nor how long they have played - you will have
to evaluate each of these users yourself to determine if they should
be deleted (ie. ask yourself when the last time they logged in, if they
play mmud, etc.).
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
*** NOTE ***<BR>
If you choose to delete a user, THEY ARE DELETED.  There is no undo.
