 MajorMUD - Realm of Legends                      Sysop-Only Release Notes
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 For pre-1.1n sysop-only release notes and other MajorMUD information
 (including all the licensing terms), please refer to wccmmud.rln
                    +        Version 1.11m - 02/03/2003       +
1) The Sys Unwrap command is no longer available
2) Sys goto Support is now only available to a player with the SYSOP key
3) Limited Items that can not be placed in a room will be sent to the
   sysop support room. Rooms have been added to the sysop support room
   to avoid overflooding.
4) It is now possible to trigger invasions from the support room. These
   invasions take place in the slums or the Darkwood Forest. Monsters
   that are generated by the trigger but not killed will be removed by an
   offline recovery. To avoid input problems it would be wise not to 
   trigger these while using MegaMUD. The triggers can only be used once
   per cleanup. The triggers have been tested on both NT and DOS and 
   should not malfunction, however they are available at your own risk.
   The trigger commands are as follows:
   orc invasion - A horde of orcs invades the Darkwood Forest
   cult invasion - An army of the Blood God invades the Slums
   red invasion - A horde of red dragons invades the Slums
   green invasion - A horde of green dragons invades the Darkwood Forest
   
                    +        Version 1.11l - 01/23/2003       +
1)  No coding changes.

                    +        Version 1.11k - 01/03/2003       +
1)  No coding changes.

                    +        Version 1.11j - 12/23/2002       +
1)  No coding changes.

                    +        Version 1.11i - 12/21/2001       +
1)  Added new option in wccmmutl, "Remove Items from all rooms", that will
    sweep all items (including limited) from all rooms, including gang
    houses.
2)  Added new option in wccmmutl, "Remove items from non-ganghouses", that
    will sweep all items, including limiteds, from all rooms except gang
    houses.
3)  Added new options, SYS_DISABLE_GANGS, SYS_LOG_DEATHS, and
    SYS_RESET_ROOMS, which are explained in the file wccmmud.rln with the
    rest of the .ini options.
4)  Made more changes to further fix the experience display when a player
    types exp.
5)  Several bug fixes that were found in Mod 9.

                    +        Version 1.11h - 11/30/2001       +

1)  Fixed toplist display for characters that have passed the 4.2 billion
    mark.
2)  Fixed toplist display for characters that have rerolled and retained 
    some experience.
3)  Fixed display of experience to next level in the player's exp line.
4)  Added the command "unstock all" for gangshop owners to fix the problem
    where shops did not have all 10 slots available to them.
5)  Added new logging to the wccmmud.log for ganghouse cleanup.  It should
    now list every room that belongs to each house, making it easier
    to track which house is holding which limited items for sysops with 
    strict hoarding rules.
6)  Added new logging to the wccmmud.log file that records when a 
    player dies and if they were "killed," "suicided" or "rerolled".  It
    currently doesn't distinguish if they were killed by a player or a 
    monster, but that will be added later.
7)  Removed the spam logging that was happening when a player was converted
    to the new exp charts and changes to allow exp past 4.2 billion from
    the wccmmud.log file.
8)  Added database conversion for new file formats to prevent current 
    editors and viewers from immediately spoiling new versions.  If you get
    an out of memory error during installation and conversion, please 
    contact us at support@majormud.com for manual conversion steps when 
    upgrading from a version prior to 1.11h.
9)  Database conversions will make an automatic backup of your files 
    during installation.  If for any reason you need to roll back, those
    files will be found by doing a search for wcc*.wcb.  Copy those files
    back to the .dat extension and run an offline recovery to restore.
10) Fixed several memory related issues that may or may not resolve the 
    NT regen problems in prior versions.
11) Changed sys jail to become a more effective "time out" for problem
    users. This does *NOT* effect monster jail such as guards or the 
    sheriff.  Now, when a player is sent to jail using the sys god
    commands, they will be placed in "isolation" for 30 minutes, where
    they cannot speak, telepath, gossip, auction, broadcast, etc.  They
    will only be able to sit and wear their time off or exit the realm. 
    If they exit, their timer does not go away, it takes up where they
    left off when they come back.
12) Removed quest resetting via the smoky black talisman.  Players will
    now be able to "pledge" an alignment after they have completed the
    3rd alignment quest and before they have started the 5th alignment
    quest.  This will convert their quest flags to the appropriate 
    equivalent of the new aligment they have pledged. 
13) Fixed the coding bug that allowed some bbses to access Module 8 areas
    without having purchased an activation code.
14) Misc. bugs fixed.


                    +        Version 1.11g + beta patch - 12/06/2000       +

1)  Experience Bug created by previous number limit (aka 4.2 billion bug)
    NOTE: Be sure you have a current backup of your wccuser*.dat file before
    applying!
2)  Misc. Bugs fixed

                    +        Version 1.11f - 09/06/2000       +

1)  NT Cleanup Crash should now be fixed. Please report any problems.

    descriptions, BACKUP ANY CUSTOM .HSE FILES BEFORE INSTALLATION!!!

    stripped deeds.
3)  Added ganghouse tax during cleanup, Gang leader's Silvermere bank account
    is taxed every cleanup for the ganghouse

    explanatory, cleanup MUST be run after using any of these options.

                    +        Version 1.11b - 01/28/2000       +

                    +        Version 1.11a - 12/30/1999       +

1)  Turned some debugging off, which was creating a seriously large
    wccmmud.log file. You may want to check and clear (if applicable)
    this file from your server. This feature was used during development
    of Module 7 and turning it off was not accomplished. Sorry :(

                    +        Version 1.1z - 12/28/1999        +

1) No coding changes.

                    +         Version 1.1y - 12/28/1999       +

1) Added "lost city" to sys goto command.

                    +         Version 1.1x - 6/02/99           +

1) Added the sysop gangsize command (see wccmmsys.not)
2) Added the sysop unwrap command (see wccmmsys.not) NOTE: be careful
   using this command.

                    +         Version 1.1w - 12/16/98           +

1) Added blank_lastname_allowed option (see section 3.1, wccmmud.rln)
2) Added sys_topten_key option (see section 3.1, wccmmud.rln)
3) Improved feedback for Sysop commands. (Please send email to
   support@majormud.ca if you find a command which still has no
   response)
4) Documented the sysop arena command (see wccmmsys.not)
5) Added sys_disband_key option (see section 3.1, wccmmud.rln)

                    +         Version 1.1V - 9/20/98           +

1) See wccmmud.not (user based release notes)

                    +         Version 1.1v - 9/16/98           +

1) Fixed the system-freeze bug.

                    +         Version 1.1u - 9/9/98            +

1) Added the editevil key (see section 3.1 of wccmmud.rln)
2) Added enable_class_change and race_change_duration (see section 3.1)
3) Changed initrate of 20000 and update_speed of 5 to occur entirely
   before the BBS comes online.

                    +         Version 1.1t - 7/25/98           +

1) Mostly internal changes
2) Added speed option '5' to update speed - this will apply the entire
   database update before the system goes live for users.
3) Added more options to section 3.1 of wccmmud.rln
4) Added sys god <user> change sex
5) Added option 'e' to sysop menu
6) I think I may have found a way around those misbehaved globals packages
   that change the substate and then drop the user back into mud.  I can't
   test this here as we don't have any of those packages so if you know
   what I'm talking about can you please try this out with a test character
   on your system and let me know if it is fixed?  If you don't know what
   I'm talking about then don't worry about it - just make sure you've read
   all the appendices in wccmmud.rln with respect to module interactions.
7) Added the user's race name and class name to the item hoarders display
8) Added sysop disable, sysop enable, and sysop speak commands (refer to
   wccmmsys.not for more info)
9) Added sysop god <user> jail

                    +         Version 1.1s - 5/6/98            +

1) Added more commands to the ini file (ses section 3.1 in wccmmud.rln)
2) Added more feedback to some sysop commands to indicate that 
   something was done.
3) Added new sys goto targets: Rhudaur and Khazarad

                    +         Version 1.1r - 2/28/98            +

1) If a sysop misuses the sysop reset command, they can no longer
   lock the board into a loop generating thousands of monsters.
2) Added more options to section 3.1 of wccmmud.rln
3) Fixed retrain and alignment keys in section 3.1 (they were
   reversed before that)
4) Changed offline recovery to just copy the wccacmsr.vir over
   the wccacmsr.dat.  It looks like btrieve is just too slow
   when it comes to massive record deletions and the benefit of
   leaving an allocated file seems outweighed by the pain of
   the amount of time it takes to delet all the records one at
   a time.
5) Add more sysop god commands (see wccmmsys.not for more info)
   
                    +         Version 1.1q - 1/11/98           +

1) Added a warning re: sys goto from icy lake (see wccmmsys.not)

                    +         Version 1.1p - 1/5/98            +

1) Add option to display experience in top gang list (see section
   3.1 in wccmmud.rln)
2) Add keys for some of the individual gameop commands (see 3.1)
3) Added option to slow down database updating (see 3.1)
4) Will now look for the update database in either the bbs directory
   or the datadir (as specified in the CNF options) if it is not
   found in the bbs directory.
5) Made the database update a mandatory part of game startup.
6) Monsters will now get a chance to attack first in combat.
7) Added section 6.6.1 to wccmmud.rln
8) Made some changes which require an offline recovery to be run.
   If an offline recovery does not run while starting your BBS
   the first time after installing version 1.1p then please
   shutdown and run one as soon as possible.
9) With respect to the user release note of 'Increased monster
   regeneration in some areas,' one of the side-effects which
   you will see is a little more load on your system during
   startup, especially after an offline recovery.

                    +         Version 1.1o - 11/9/97           +

1) Fixed a problem where, under some circumstances, people with the
   nopay key were being charged credits at the exempt-user rate.
2) Added SYS GOD <user> RETRAIN (see wccmmsys.not for more info)
3) Fixed some bugs in the clear-evil-points and clear-saved-profiles
   routines ('c' and 'cp' on the sysop menu) and improved their
   performance.
4) Added wccmmud.ini processing.  See section 3.1 in wccmmud.rln
5) Fixed some bugs that caused my timeout routine to kick normal
   client/server users offline

                    +         Version 1.1n - 10/11/97          +

1) Since it seems like the baseline timeout only 'sometimes' takes over
   the inactivity timeout while in the MajorMUD menu I've changed
   MajorMUD's timeout to be active in the menu as well.
2) If you're only charging your users the exempt credit charges then
   it will now charge them while in the MajorMUD menu as well.
3) Removed the regular recovery option from wccmmutl and made it so
   that the only recovery option available is the fast recovery.
4) Obsoleted the reindex limited items menu option on the sysop
   menu as the preferred solution is to run the offline recovery.
5) Updated the sysop documentation (wccmmud.rln) to reflect the
   obsoletion of the 'fast' option now that all recovery is done in
   'fast' mode.
6) Changed DEATHHP to have a minimum value of -20000 so if you had
   it set lower than this then you'll have to change this option
   before you can start your system.
