  <b><font color=#ffcc33><b>7.1) THE EVIL/LEGAL SYSTEM</b></font>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
      MajorMUD controls the users by giving evil points for actions which
      are considered 'bad'.  As these evil points accumulate on a user they
      will start to be punished by the game.  This starts by allowing other
      users to attack them without penalty.  It then progresses to having
      guards attack them on site.  After that, bounty-hunters and other
      monsters will be generated with the specific purpose of attacking
      the user.  After that the gods will begin to punish them by striking
      them with lightning.  You may use the online sysop commands to alter
      a user's evil level and thereby alter the way the game will treat
      that user.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
      When a user first creates a character they get the chance to choose
      to be a 'lawful' character.  If they make this choice then they are
      forever banned from instigating any action which would give them
      evil points.  Anyone attacking them is also given a larger number
      of evil points than for a normal attack.  Although a user may not
      change the state of their original decision regarding lawfulness
      without rerolling, you may use the online sysop god commands to alter
      this state.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
      You can configure the rate at which users lose evil points using the
      CNF options MAXEPDAY, EPCYCLE, and EPAMOUNT.  At cleanup, any user
      who has played the game and who has done any evil actions will
      have their evil points reduced by 2 evil points.  Any user who has
      played the game without any evil action will have their evil points
      reduced by 3 plus the following formula:
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
      (EPAMOUNT * (minutes played in game that day/EPCYCLE))<br><br>

      The total number of evil points that will be forgiven are based on
      the value of MAXEPDAY.  Note also that when moving from neutral towards
      GOOD or SAINT (i.e. current evil points < 0) that the base of 2 evil
      points does not apply (in other words, subtract 2 from the number of
      evil points about to be forgiven and that is how much closer to
      GOOD/SAINT the user will get).
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
      For reference points, the following define the evil point ranges
      which correspond to the reputation shown in the game.  The (EPs) shown
      in brackets indicate the results of attacking someone of that
      reputation.<br><br>

      down to less than 300.<br><br>

      ** NOTE ** DO NOT adjust any evil point values (either CNF or online)
      unless you know what you are doing.  Use the SYSOP LIST USERS command
      to see what the current evil levels of your users are and use that to
      guide you in these settings.  Neither West Coast Creations nor the
      staff or close-to-staff members of Dreamscape BBS will provide any
      guidance on setting these aside from pointing you back to the default
      values.  Settings which are incorrect -for-your-system- may result in
      your users quitting the game due to other users taking advantage of
      them.
