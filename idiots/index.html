      One day in the realm, there was a Tommie (name changed to protect ME).&nbsp;
      Tommie usually leaves his scripts (he has 3 characters on this particular
      board) running at work at night, but has the script log off at work, from
      9:00 PM - midnight, in case he wants to play at<br>
      home. On the evening in question, he logs in his primary character (lvl 38
      HOG warrior), and sees that the character, whom he left running in the
      Ironwoods with the other two, is at pretty low HPs, and<br>
      poisoned.&nbsp; Being a HOG, the poison wears off shortly, and he rests
      up.&nbsp; He logs the other two characters in (lvl 17 priest and lvl 24
      mage), and sees that they are both in the negative digits.&nbsp; He heals
      them up,<br>
      gets everyone up and running, and decides to move them to a safer place to
      finish out the evening.&nbsp; He moves them over to the orc barracks, and
      starts the script running from home, then goes to bed, after seeing the
      boys safely in their groove.&nbsp; The next morning, he<br>
      sees that all three had dropped during the night, and, a little
      frustrated, just closes the screens, planning on fixing the difficulty
      when he arrives at work.&nbsp; He gets to work, and, to his surprise,
      finds his HOG warrior up and running the Ironwood Forest Loop. After
      scrolling back through the convo box, he notices that around 5:00 AM,
      someone gossips &quot;Geez, Tommie! Come in or go out, make up your
      mind!&quot;&nbsp; Tommie's heart<br>
      sank, as he realized that his HOG warrior had not been dropped, but just
      logged off, as normal.&nbsp; So, at the stroke of midnight, the script at
      work logged in, and, due to the handy ghosting feature of the BBS, the<br>
      scripts at work and home had been redialing and knocking each other off.&nbsp;
      AND, since Tommie's BBS settings were set to 1000 redials, at 30 second
      breaks, the nighttime dwellers of the realm saw Tommie<br>
      login in about 2000 times in the space of 8 hours. And the dupes were
      killed, one by being left alone in the Orc Barracks, and the other by
      being dragged through the silver river without a skiff, by a blind,<br>
      poisoned HOG warrior who was frantically trying to decide if he wanted to
      script the Ironwoods, or the Barracks.&nbsp;

<div>
  <div>
    <div>
      My buddy and I decided to assault a rival clan's gang house, suspecting<br>
      the ninja quest weapon was stored inside.&nbsp; I wanted it for my dupe<br>
      character, a level 39 ninja, who is not only the highest ninja in the<br>
      realm, but pretty much the only one left playing.&nbsp; We were going in
      with<br>
      my lvl 55 cleric, my 39 ninja, and my friend's 45 mystic.&nbsp; We were<br>
      fairly confident we could take the guardians, but were prepared for a<br>
      battle just the same.&nbsp; My ninja picks the front door, and as we
      prepare<br>
      to go in guns blazing, my friend tells me to hold up.&nbsp; I look in, and<br>
      sitting right on the floor at the entrance to the gang house are 2<br>
      emblems!&nbsp; Suffice to say, we soon had the run of the place, finding<br>
      still another few emblems inside, plenty of gear, and the ebony ninjato.

<div>
  <div>
    <div>
      Our realm is a non pvp realm (PVP disabled).&nbsp; Our fearless tommies
      begin their quest for greatness by moving in on a few of the mid level
      players in the realm trying to horn in on some good exp without
      asking.&nbsp; Figuring that the tommies did not have megamud set properly,
      area spells were used and bam! &nbsp;Tommies hang up.&nbsp; Well, they
      decide that this is not going to work so they then set their megamud to
      attack anyone who attacks them in a non pvp realm.&nbsp;So next time area
      spells are used to discourage them, they begin trying to attack the person
      who cast the area spell.&nbsp; Of course they quit fighting the monsters
      in the room when they do this :)&nbsp; If this isn't Tommie enough for
      you, 1 of the MYSTICS was trying to cast entangle as a combat spell!

      <font face="Arial" size="2">Well me being the village idiot (As a gaunt
      palladin I spent all my time in elder grove by level 4), I decide to rob a
      ganghouse. The Blue one to be exact. So i go there hoping to pick the lock
      (lockpick skill of 5-duuh) and find their door and&nbsp;vault keys on sale
      in their shop. FOR 25 GOLD !!!. So i buy them and open the first door. BTW
      at this time I'm a level 10 Paladin. So the Tommie paladin walks into the
      room thinking: &quot;Oh there's only 3 of them i can handle it&quot;. 1
      round I'm dead: i don't even get a chance to swing. So i gossip to the
      gang members that i did this and they laugh at me and give me my stuff
      back. They also invite me to the gang (i was gangless) and give me the
      emblem. The leader said: &quot;Well you're either really dumb, or really
      brave, either way you'll fit in with us&quot;. I guess stupidity pays off

                died, and their deathpiles raided by a couple of oxygen thieves
                that made no small secret of their activities.&nbsp; Now I was
                scripting in the wooden passage and my 2 buddies were in the AC.&nbsp;
                I get a page that Banzai and Hiss are in the AC - they were both
                Villain - and were not killing any monsters....I ran in there
                and we joined up...one of my buddies couldnt hit either of them,
                because he was too low, but he could heal us.&nbsp; I
                immediately BSd banzai with my heavy black rod (we called it the
                spoogin rod) and luckily blinded him.&nbsp; He tried to run but
                kept hitting the walls, so we went to work on Hiss.&nbsp; The
                moaner loved banzai and they both hung up...since there was no
                PvP penalty on this board, we didnt get any real benefit...so we
                had to wait.&nbsp; Sure enough, Hiss came in first, then
                Banzai..they had been lurking in the menuing system.&nbsp; We
                both nailed banzai and dropped him.&nbsp; Hiss grabs banzai and
                runs.&nbsp; My killing partner was a ranger, so tracking wasnt a
                problem, but HIss must have gotten lost because he came back
                with banzai going the other way...our sneak was broken so I used
                my crimson bracers and KILLED them both.&nbsp; Sure enough, all
                the missing gear was there..the rest of it was garbage, except
                for Hiss' magebane.&nbsp; Well sure enough, the trash talking
                starts on gos.&nbsp; Banzai starts calling names and complaining
                we were attacking his script.&nbsp; Hiss is just&nbsp; an
                obscene little maggot and...he says &quot;Yeah...we were just
                walkin around there and then Lusiphur (my partner) casts some

                sickle.&nbsp; Now the 3 of us are sitting on the pier hidden as
                they pass us to go get their gear.&nbsp; When they walk back, I
                drop the magebane.&nbsp; Hiss is almost fully clothed, banzai
                has clothes but no weapon.&nbsp; So he picks it up and engages
                combat with me.&nbsp; I go 2 rooms south and hide...and he isnt
                following....Im screaming in broadcast to lusi to see if he
                needs help...and lusi says &quot;Hes not attacking us&quot;/&nbsp;
                Instead, the come into my room and I nail him with the rod and

            informed the entire realm, over gossip, that he had typed I only to

            <P>One day I decided to take my level 32 half-ogre thief and level 
            21 dark elf mystic to the apperatus. After a tireless battle with 
            plague crafters, It was time to work on the lock. My thief, being 
            half-ogre, had little intelligence. The job of working the lock went 
            to the mystic. Not thinking, and using megamud I telepathed the 
            mystic with @do solve puzzle and checked the room for an open door. 
            Nothing happened. I telepathed it back two more times and pressed 
            enter to check for the open door. What I saw remimded me of 2 
            things. One, that the puzzle lock zaps you when you fail to solve 
            it. Second and more important was the fact that the mystic had only 
            one life remaining. The door was still closed, and there was quite a 
            bit of gear strewn around the ground including one loyal phoenix 
            feather. My heart sank as i clicked on the icon on the start menu 
            labled Tommie (-18%) and saw those immortal words... You have no 
            lives remaining! Ironically the dumbfounded half-ogre solved the 
            puzzle in one try, carrying the mystic's scalded and burnt clothing 
            with him.

            <P>One day Tommie 1 decided he was going to mess around with Tommie 
            2. Now these 2 had been fighting for about a month in a gang war. 
            Tommie 2 was a lutenant of a gang that had the gold house. One day 
            Tommie 1 bet Tommie 2 that He/She could get into the gold house 
            vault, Tommie 1 invited Tommie 2 to come along, thinking that He/She 
            was just bluffing. They met in TS and Tommie 1 invited Tommie 2 and 
            Tommie 2 joined. They began walking to the Gold house when all of 
            the sudden Tommy said @party give gold emblem to Tommie 1, followed 
            by @party give ornate gold to Tommie 1 and finally @party give gold 
            key to Tommie 1. And so he did just as he said he would...He/She 
            helped His/Herself to the Gold houses riches :)

            gathering a load of folks to go on a boss run.&nbsp; This board was 
            a pvp board.&nbsp; People often scripted in groups so of course 
            everyone had the "Defend Party" option in Megamud turned on.&nbsp; 
            There ended up being about 20 people on this run so we ended up with 
            about 4 or 5 parties all being dragged by one person.&nbsp; 2 of the 
            players, Tommie 1, a level 30 mage, and Tommie 2, a level 27 Gypsy, 
            had their Auto Nuke option turned on in megamud since they scripted 
            together and no one else scripted their areas. As we were heading 
            out to kill the first boss, we ran into a room with 2 monsters in 
            it.&nbsp; The Tommies had the faster connections (Same person with a 
            dupe) so they engaged combat first.&nbsp; Since there was more than 
            1 monster in the room, they both attempted to nuke the room.&nbsp; 
            Of course this also attacked everyone else in the room who was not 
            part of the party that they were in.&nbsp; Since everyone in the 
            other parties had auto defend on, they all attacked the tommies, the 
            party that the tommies was in then proceeded to defend their party 
            from attack. When the dust settled, the only people left alive were 
            a level 42 witchie, who had about 10 hps left, myself, a level 10 
            warrior who wasto low to fight anyone, and another low level 
            player.Moral for this story?&nbsp; Check your Megamud settings 
            before heading out to party!

            changes.&nbsp; (He actually had bought it, just didn't want to be 
            pestered to death about installing it)&nbsp; Well Tommie decides 
            that he is tired of waiting for the update, and is going to just 
            reroll into something better than a warrior.&nbsp; Tommie does a sys 
            goto newhaven, and rerolls.&nbsp; At some point in the 8 months he 
            had been playing he had typed SET KEEP OFF.&nbsp; So we had a brand

            one of my boards, we've got a fairly low top ten list, im #6 with 60 
            mil or so.. anyways.. the #5 player, a d-elf mystic, with about 80 
            mil exp got killed in mithril mines, and got help to go get his 
            gear.&nbsp; after a lot of dying &lt;his helpers werent well suited 
            to save ppl from mith mines&gt; they managed to get his gear and 
            started to leave.&nbsp; Well before they got out this mystic decided 
            to leave the party, and all but one of them got killed again.&nbsp; 
            They managed to get their gear back.. with no help from the mystic 
            of course, and not without pissing off at least one of his saviours 
            badly.&nbsp; He was warned that maybe he couldnt handle that area 
            and that he should move.. but being the tommie he is he decided to 
            go play in there some more, and died again.. only this time noone 
            helped him to go get his gear &lt;hmm i wonder why&gt; and he ended 
            up being rerolled.&nbsp; Now i suppose this could happen to anyone 
            and wouldnt necessarily constitute a tommie story, except that he 
            had to run all the way back from silvermere to khaz to get to his 
            gear.. passing 2 banks on the way, and having to go in at least one 
            for the rope/mine pass cash.&nbsp;Well after his reroll he realized 
            that he had lost 5 runic, and that lives only cost 50 plat 
            there.&nbsp;&nbsp;The realm all had a good laugh at him and everyone 
            was happy.. cept him of course

            Paladin and my level 28 Warrior in the laby, as I came out of the 
            hole I decided to rest. For some odd reason I went to the blue gang 
            house which is located to the west, I went to the shop and searched 
            and found a blue house key. The Tommie gang leader decided to be 
            cocky and drop a key there a see if anyone would go in and try to 
            seal some stuff and get hacked to pieces by the guardians. He knew 
            that if he didn't leave some more bait no one woul go in the house 
            so he left a few sapphire emblems in the first room and bought a 
            bunch of extra guardians so if anyone tried to get them they would 
            die in one round. I laughed to myself created a nice little macro 
            and got one of the emblems for myself and my 2nd character. After 
            that i looted their nice little house which was stacked up to the 
            brink with goodies. The only think that shows that this Tommie had a 
            brain is that he didn't leave a safe key laying around, tho that 
            might be his next idea for baiting people to get in his gang house!

            one they were always grave-robbing/stealing and being general 
            nuisances. Well, one day I, a Level 21 Ranger, and my friend a level 
            34 Warrior tracked them all the way to the Black Fort where we had 
            said we died. We caught up to them and proceeded to attack them. As 
            we did a Dark Mage regenerated and they went from attacking us to 
            attacking it. They beat the mage easily but were hurt from our 
            attacks. Since the mage died they reengaged on us and to our 
            surprise yet another mage walked in, they immediately attacked it, 
            and we landed the final blow, killing them. We got away with all 
            their goodies and only took about 18 damage in the process.

            <P>One day, me being a level 43 Gaunt-one / Ninja, was chilling in 
            the bank.&nbsp;Well, a level 32&nbsp;Dark-Elf / Ranger, who will 
            remain anonymous, decided to follow me as I was taking some newbies 
            on an experience run(a level 19 Goblin / Thief and a level 15 
            Missionary) after listening to our conversation in the <SPAN 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>bank.&nbsp; Me being a 
            Gaunt-one and doing the "see hidden" quest, could obviously, see 
            hidden.&nbsp; So we were on our merry little way to kill Aurumvorox 
            and the low levels needed to rest.&nbsp; I on the other hand, 
            didn't.&nbsp; So instead of resting anyway, I hid, waiting for a 
            monster or anything to walk into the room to prevent the newbies 
            form dying.&nbsp; I was getting bored from the long wait, and 
            pressed enter luckily.&nbsp; There he was...hidden {in case you 
            never seen it before, it would look like this...Tommie 
            (hidden)*}.&nbsp; I figured he was going to try to BS me or 
            something, so I waited.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; I thought to myself, 
            "maybe he is just wanting to tag along."&nbsp; Well, this guy was a 
            regular trash talker, who could hardly ever back his words up; so I 
            figured he didn't have the balls to attack me.&nbsp; He had been 
            begging me to sell my multi-coloured sash and cat's eye for weeks, 
            denying him every time.&nbsp; Being the regular Tommie he is, he 
            would say something that would anger my gang, and they would hunt 
            him down and he'd hang (yada, yada) and come back later 
            apologizing.&nbsp; Same thing every day.&nbsp; So, I thought, maybe 
            he's thinking he will follow us until we got there, hoping I'd get 
            low on hp's and he could kill me in one BS.&nbsp; Well, we moved on, 
            stopping every once and a while so I can see if he is still 
            following us.&nbsp; Sure enough, there he is, hidden.&nbsp; So I 
            said," ok, he's hunting me..."&nbsp;We go to the Aurumvorox and 
            killed it easily.&nbsp; He made the mistake of peeking in.&nbsp; I 
            knew he was gonna try to BS me.&nbsp; I hid and kept hitting 
            enter.&nbsp; After hitting enter about 30 times, I could see him 
            hidden.&nbsp; He tried to do poison cloud and got the newbies, but I 
            resisted, I hid again. He hid too, thinking I couldn't see him, but 
            being Gaunt-one, I did.&nbsp; I BS'ed him with my trusty vorpal 
            sword for about 235 and he dropped.&nbsp; <SPAN 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>I broke combat and aided him, 
            to play with him.&nbsp; He said, "Why you attacked me."&nbsp; I 
            said, "cause I want give you this."&nbsp; I hid, and BS'ed him 
            again.&nbsp; Tommie is dead.&nbsp; Now, anyone else probably would 
            have left their good stuff behind, but no, not Tommie.&nbsp; The 
            moron, not knowing I could see hidden, lost a Starsteel mace, 
            Mithril ring, belt of might, black leather tunic, adamantite 
            bracers, an Elven cloak, and about 5 runics.&nbsp; He asked for his

            Tommie at our pvp range :) myself, and a warlock just waiting for 
            him :)&nbsp; well, he quieted down since he knew we were after him 
            but we had already had enough.&nbsp; We found him roaming and 
            attacked him and I took his stuff to the incinerator.&nbsp; I then 
            hid myself in TS and he logged on, went to TS just like I knew he 
            would and started searching for items.&nbsp; Instead, he found me 
            waiting for him.&nbsp; Now, knowing that he was in range of 2 irate 
            spellcasters, he did not bother putting any points on at all on 
            willpower.&nbsp; So, his little level 30 Witchie was defenseless and 
            after a short game of cat and mouse, I hit him with entangle, 2 
            earthfists, he ran one room and I hit him one more time and dropped 
            him :)&nbsp; Toe to toe with a low willpower Witchie.&nbsp; This 
            game proceeded until we finally rerolled him.&nbsp; After that he 
            made yet another low willpower Witchie but was a little humbled 
            since he was now at level 20 :)</P>

            <P>Okay, so we decided to kill the adult she-dragon for the first 
            time.&nbsp; We spent 2 weeks planning it making sure to be all 
            online on the day of killing.&nbsp; When that day finally arrived, 
            the mage and I spent the morning roaming lave fields and collecting 
            hides for amulets.&nbsp; Late in the afternoon we came ak and added 
            our amulets to the rest of the groups which all totalled up to about 
            20 or so.&nbsp; There were 6 of us going so we had plenty in case we 
            should die.&nbsp; After 30 minutes of arguing and trying to organize 
            our little group, we finally make it outside her room.&nbsp; We 
            spelled ourselves up and went in.&nbsp; Megamud had just come out so 
            not all of us were using it.&nbsp; The ranger types a dr and as you 
            know that will not attack the adult she-dragon, but it DID attack 
            the mudop who's name started with dr!&nbsp; In all the confusion 
            scrolling across the screen no one noticed and he sys-goto'ed to 
            town almost dead.&nbsp; Soon after the Ranger died and the battle 
            turned to the dragon's favor.&nbsp; The paladin was the only one who 
            was able to run south before he died.&nbsp; The mage spent an hour 
            sneaking in and getting our stuff and when he had 95% of it all, he 
            finally got caught in a muddle spell and called for help. Now, 
            knowing that the ranger was his only hope, myself and another 
            warrior went in anyway with him and we all got muddled instantly. 
            The ranger failed at casting freedom and we all got trashed and the 
            mage had to start all over again with the death piles!&nbsp; When we 
            FINALLY got our stuff back, and another mudop logged on, a cleric, 
            (which made our party 3 warriors, a ranger, mage, paly, and cleric) 
            we decided to try again and restore our honour.&nbsp;&nbsp; We went 
            in and what do I do? "a dr" the mudop sys goto's to town almost 
            dead! :) He's not happy at this point and the ranger bites it again 
            and dies quickly.&nbsp; But with the cleric, we are holding our own 
            and got her down to very crit.&nbsp; At this point the mage decides 
            he has had enough and leaves.&nbsp; Now with him gone and another 
            death in our group, she starts healing faster then we can hit 
            her.&nbsp; I yell out to the mage to get his ass back in before she 
            heals too much and kills us all again and he comes back and we 
            won!&nbsp; But since the room was full of gear already, she dropped 
            absolutely nothing!&nbsp; Oh well, lessons were learned that day 
            :)</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>A Tommie by any other name</FONT></P>
            <P>On the board that I play at, there is Tommie. He claimed he has 
            played mud for about 1 - 1.5 years, and he has always played a 
            ninja. He kept asking questions that were repetitive and pointless. 
            After about 2 weeks of these annoying questions day after day, the 
            op's decided to change his name to: Tommie. He has kept the name 
            since. (Not that it stopped the questions )</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Dying to Get Together</FONT></P>
            <P>One day a lvl 51 Gnome Mystic (Tommie #1) was having some people 
            over to his house for a BBS Get Together. He was on his way out to 
            the Rakhashas with but one single life left. (Big Mistake) When he 
            entered the well he proceeded to get out on the other side into 
            Rak's. Some people started talking to him and he accidentally sat 
            one room from the exit of the well for about 4 minutes. When he 
            looked up again it said, "You have been killed!" which of course 
            rerolled him. Now that isn't even the best part. Our lovely Sysop 
            who is also a sort of a Tommie in this case, was talking to him 
            about his Rerolling incident. Tommie #1 exclaimed to our sysop that 
            he was not in the well, he was out of the well and somehow there 
            began a new "Out of Well Bug" that you drown when you are one room 
            outside of the well. Gullible little Sysop Tommie #2 believing him, 
            edited him back his 900 Million exp putting Tommie #1 back to his 
            spot at #2 on the board.</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>The bug bites back</FONT></P>
            <P>I have played mud for a number of years, and never heard of 
            anything this stupid. One of the boards I was playing on allowed the 
            Mermex bug (this was before the new mod fixed it). So the mudops 
            would help out with it and allow you to have sys goto, a command for 
            lightning, and lives on request. Well one day one of the largest in 
            the realm, a level 43 warrior, decides he wants to be "bugged"...he 
            was doing just fine on running and getting poisoned and dieing and 
            getting the +5 to int, str, and agil. The one thing he was 
            forgetting to do was to have the mudops fill his lives when he got 
            low...needless to say he wasn't a level 43 warrior for long :).</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Held up at the gate</FONT></P>
            <P>&nbsp;I have an interesting story about a clever PvP'er (that'd 
            be me) and a not so bright Tommie (the guy I killed).&nbsp; I play 
            on a board that doesn't allow script killing.&nbsp; No 
            problem!&nbsp; If they're afk, I won't kill them.&nbsp; I was 
            sitting in the bank with my level 33 Dark-Elf Ranger when this 
            Warrior I wasn't too fond of walked in.&nbsp; We talked some small 
            talk a little... blah blah blah.&nbsp; I think he was level 35-39 
            Half-Orc with some nice stuff.&nbsp; I don't have the best 
            reputation and being a little bored decided to hint at the fact that 
            I was going to try and kill him.&nbsp; Hearing this he decided 
            to<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; "start his script" and run 
            run run down to the lava fields or sallies or somewhere down 
            there.&nbsp; So, basically, I had to kill him before he got there or 
            he would go AFK.&nbsp; I first attacked him on the Grand Stair while 
            he was searching for exits... being a Warrior he just shrugged off 
            my BS and kept going.&nbsp; He opened the gate at the bottom but I 
            beat him to it, went through and closed it.&nbsp; He, surely not 
            realizing what happened, when back to reopen the gate but I had 
            already done so and passed through it, back to the Grand Stair 
            side.&nbsp; So, when he pulled the lever, he actually closed the 
            gate again.&nbsp; When he ran back down to it (bumping into it a few 
            times) there I was to BS him.&nbsp; Since he wasn't attacking 
            monsters (trying to save time to get away from me) he was also a 
            little lower on hps.&nbsp; The Dark Priest in the room casting hold 
            person on him was a nice touch too.&nbsp; I waited around for awhile 
            and when he finally came back in, there I was waiting to kill him 
            and increased my inventory of various Warrior junk... some pretty 
            good, though useless to me.&nbsp; All in all it was pretty fun.</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Timing is Everything</FONT></P>
            <P>I (A Former level 42 Witchunter) got very tired of Mud one day 
            and told the realm that I was going to sell my character (I was the 
            highest level character in the realm at the time). Tommie overheard 
            this and offered 200 dollars for my character.&nbsp; Between being 
            tired of the game and wanting to by a 3DFx Card I said it was 
            cool.&nbsp; We met and he gave me the cash and I gave him the 
            password.&nbsp; About 2 weeks after I sold my character to Tommie, 
            he rerolled my Witchie for no real reason but to become a 
            Warrior.&nbsp; Needless to say, about 3 days after he did that the 
            new Mod came out that gives you the opportunity to change your 
            race/class upon entering the game......&nbsp;&nbsp; Sigh....

            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Tag Team Tommies</FONT></P>
            <P>There's this Tommie, who shall remain nameless.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            Actually, there's about 4 or 5 Tommies in this happy little 
            story.&nbsp; All these "Tommies" are in the same gang, they chum 
            together, overall I'd say they were very good friends.&nbsp; Here 
            they are:</P>
            <P>Tommie 1: level 17 or so D-Elf Ranger <BR>Tommie 2: level 26 Half 
            Ogre Warrior<BR>Tommie 3: level 9 Goblin Ninja<BR>Tommie 4: level 23 
            Dwarf priest<BR>
            <P>And me, a level 20 Kang Witchunter.</P>
            <P>Now me, and these Tommies, didn't get along very well. In fact we 
            hated each other. So I'm sitting at Town Square, minding my own 
            business. (Oh by the way all these Tommies are evil, the 
            Ranger/Warrior/priest are FIEND, the Warrior was villain)&nbsp; 
            along comes happy-go-lucky Tommie 1, and he decides to BS me.&nbsp; 
            Me, being the non-pvp'er that I am, ran west (towards the 
            temple)&nbsp;about 5 rooms west of TS (Temple and Stone St. I 
            believe) sits 2 Templars.&nbsp; I run into that room.&nbsp; Tommie 
            1, most likely not thinking, follows me in, sneaking of course. He 
            BS's me again, for a low # it wasn't even worth laughing about.. So 
            I sat there while the Templars proceeded to hold person him and make 
            sure he became GOOD friends with their greatswords..&nbsp; About 4 - 
            5 rounds pass, Tommie 1 obviously thinking he can kill me, and grab 
            my stuff, and still be at enough hp to hang then get dragged out 
            lager on, sits there and is hitting and hitting me.&nbsp; He drops 
            to the ground, and hangs.&nbsp; In the mean time, Tommy 3 comes in 
            and tries to BS me, but misses, and the Templars proceed to hold 
            person and attack him. He, being a LITTLE smarter (not too sure 
            about the whole "smart" idea) hangs the 1st round after he's been 
            hit.. Takes hardly any damage.&nbsp; Both Tommie 1 and Tommie 3 are 
            sitting at menuing system, and they apparently page Tommie 2, and he 
            heads over there himself.&nbsp; I'm sitting there, happily back up 
            to full HP because by this time all Tommies involved are worrying 
            about their stuff rather than lil ol me. :)&nbsp; So Tommie 2 enters 
            the room. Bam, hold person and greatsword. Tommie 2 tries KILLING 
            the Templars, but in the mean time a guardsman had come into the 
            room, and beat him to slums. So Tommie 2 has hold person cast on him 
            at slum crossroads.&nbsp; Tommie 4 comes in, and hold persons me 
            (for god only knows why) I laugh as him, being a weak priest, gets 
            the shizola beat out of him (and also held) by the Templars / guard. 
            so he sits there healing himself, trying to out last them and run.. 
            But he doesn't. And he drops. So now Tommies 1, 3, 4 are dropped in 
            that room, and Tommie 2 is held at slum x-roads.&nbsp; Tommies 1-3-4 
            for some reason enter the realm, and now, having 3 town defenders in 
            the room (Templar, Templar guard) all three of them die. Now I've 
            just been buried in almost 25 runic worth of weapons and armour, and 
            they are all the way deep in slums.&nbsp; Needless to say, I had a 
            fat wallet and many limited items for a long, long time.&nbsp; And 
            after that I got as much as I could carry, and proceeded to run my 
            happy (now heavy) ass to the bank and sit there with all my new 
            toys.&nbsp; All in all, they apologized for the "trouble" and said 
            that if I give them some of the stuff back, I can keep the rest, no 
            hard feelings.&nbsp; So I kept it all, and had no hard feelings 
            :)&nbsp; god I love MMud.. :)</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Tommie gets a lesson in PvP</FONT></P>
            <P>One day I was sitting in Town Square with my lvl 18 druid waiting 
            for a few friends and all of a sudden some outcast (who was evil) 
            and one of his friends gets there before any of mine. Tommie was a 
            lvl 15 mystic...naturally he started some BS and bs'd me. I then ran 
            south and Tommie didn't follow, sneaking north again I bs'd 
            him...entangled him...and acid jetted him and he hung. After an hour 
            or so Tommie logged back on thinking I would be gone. I was of 
            course waiting in the shadows and when I bs'd him he ran north and 
            hung. Luckily with my knowledge of room speed, I went 2 north and 
            hid again. This time it only took one bs to kill Tommy, having first 
            choice at the yard sale that was now at my feet, I took his Clawed 
            Gloves, Mithril Ring and basically anything that I thought I could 
            sell for a profit. I bet this Tommie will remember my name forever.

            <P>One evening this Tommie who was a level 16 Ninja thought he would 
            be brave and talk a lot of crap to me a level 49 mage #1 in the 
            realm. So after about an hr and a half of us badgering each other 
            back and forth I set up my script in dragons and went to bed. I woke 
            up the next morning checking MegaMud like normal and saw I had been 
            attacked. &lt;Script was still going&gt; So I look who it is and it 
            was that Tommie I then walk around looking for his gear and after 
            retracing the whole lava tube I type top 50 &lt;he was #45&gt; and 
            he wasn't there. Later that day he logged on and I found out he 
            tried to kill my script 9 times loosing every life to my script. Go 
            MegaMud, sfog/fork...</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Tommie Tries to Fight Back</FONT></P>
            <P>One day, Tommie, a lvl 27 Ranger, gossiped that he had gotten an 
            Ebony Kris.&nbsp;I very much needed one considering it is pretty 
            much the best weapon for me. Tommie and I have been rivals for as 
            long as I knew him and I was a lvl 23 mystic.&nbsp; Now, Tommie 
            could have easily killed me many times except for the fact that his 
            PvP skills were a dead zero.&nbsp; As soon as I saw the gossip, I 
            quickly told Tommie to hand over the Kris and I would leave him 
            alone for a while (I have killed him a few times in the past month 
            for no reason other than he was a jerk and I forced him into my gang 
            a while before that) so he was almost willing to give it up except 
            he didn't want me to kill him after I got it. So telling him that he 
            either dies and loosing all his stuff<SPAN 
            style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; definitely, or giving up the Kris 
            and having a chance that I might be nice and let him live, he tells 
            me to meet him at TS.&nbsp; So I do and he comes in and drops the 
            Kris. I bow to him and take/equip it.&nbsp; No more than a second 
            later, I press enter and he is gone, then again and he is 
            back.&nbsp; Hmm, I hide and see Tommie says: "bs r"&nbsp; I bs him 
            and he runs east, I press enter and he's back, and I repeat the 
            steps above again and he dies.&nbsp; I gossip a quick laugh and grab 
            all his items except for his keys and gold.</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Tommy Vs the Pipe</FONT></P>
            <P>Tommie was a young Mud player, as well as a low-level Bard. 
            Tommie thought he'd be slick and steal from one of my gang members. 
            Tommie did complete his quest and stole a black and white serpent 
            ring. Tommie, being foolish, made me aware of what he had done. 
            Within a minute or so Tommie wanted to test out his backstabbing 
            ability. Tommie attacked another one of my gang members, knowing the 
            rest of the gang was live. Tommie thought he'd make things better 
            and offered to give back the black and white serpent ring. I went to 
            TS with a group of my gang and gratefully accepting his pay-back. 
            Tommie then missed his BS on me and ran. After a few minutes of pvp 
            we met with him next to the mad wizard. He then PULLED on the pipe, 
            while we attacked him, and dropped himself before we could. We then 
            laughed and watched as he bled to death.</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Pure Stupidity :)</FONT></P>
            <P>One day I, being about a lvl 15 Warrior, said that I would help a 
            level 8 newbie out in getting to the mad wizard.&nbsp; Now, this 
            Tommie was a friend of one of the top 5 on our board and the board 
            only had about 12 paying users therefore most of the best stuff was 
            monopolized by the top players and Tommie had the best stuff he 
            could for his level on.&nbsp; So, wanting to kill him yet couldn't 
            because of the PvP lvl, I told him that in order to get to the mad 
            wizard, he had to type pull lever in the slime room 50 times in 5 
            seconds.&nbsp; He told me that he couldn't type that fast so I told 
            him how to make a macro using Qmodem and he did.&nbsp; I just told 
            Tommie to hold down the macro button until the door opened so he did 
            but the door just never opened like planned yet I certainly got my 
            moneys worth.</P>

            <P>Tommie, a newbie into Mud when it first came out, was a lvl 15 
            Paladin. A player that we shall refer to as Trickster, had told 
            Tommie and his friends that if you had a Quest Weapon that didn't 
            belong to your class in your inventory, it would kill you. One day 
            Tommie was fighting him, and typed "give Shimmering Longsword to 
            Trickster". Needless to say it didn't kill him, and he ran off with 
            the Shimmering laughing at Tommie.</P>

            <P>This Tommie is a lvl 7 Warrior, I was a lvl 16 Ninja. Well Tommie 
            decided to take my find broadsword and sell it after picking through 
            my death pile. When I asked for it back I was told to blow him, so I 
            wander to the Graveyard and see him. One BS and he was dead. That 
            gets him mad and he starts calling me stupid and other names. So...I 
            go down to the Shadowy Healer where he is sitting and BS him again, 
            he dies of course. When he comes back he tries to run, but I follow 
            him about 5 rooms before getting another BS on him...oops dead 
            again. Well about now Tommie is hating life and logs off swearing 
            and cursing. When I tell my gang members about the event, they say 
            that they will attack him on sight. By the end of the week Tommie 
            was rerolled 3 times by either me or my gang members. ;)</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>More silly PvP Deaths</FONT></P>
            <P>One of my gang members, who I was not so good of friends with, 
            was in the bank one day talking to one of the female players of the 
            realm. So I walk in after a hard day of scripting, and say "Hi" to 
            him. He says "Hey, you're a loser and I don't want you in our gang 
            anymore" Then this lvl 14 Warlock, dares me to go outside the Bank. 
            So he walks outside trying to show off for his "girl", anyways, I 
            sneak out and BS him. He runs south and east until he comes to the 
            manhole in the alley, then gossips that I am a loser and that he is 
            AFK. Well being a lvl 18 Ninja I just tracked him down, a quick BS 
            and he was history. Looking through his death pile, I decided he 
            owed me something for the insults, so took his Quest Weapon and 
            Quest Ring among other things. When he comes back he decides that 
            "I" was being a jerk to him and whines about it in gossips and gang 
            paths asking for his stuff back, saying that he had just been 
            joking. Bottom line is that he got killed again ;)</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Bill Gates meets MegaMud</FONT></P>
            <P>One fine evening Tommie starts to hang up and relog over and 
            over. The BBS that he plays has a ghosting feature that you can log 
            on and it will kick the ghost offline for you. After about 15 
            minutes it was suggested that someone had his password and was 
            trying to log on. He told us that he hadn't given that out to anyone 
            and decided to check something. Turns out that Windows had eaten his 
            MegaMud tray icon and thinking that he was offline opened another 
            session and logged on again never dreaming that he hadn't hung in 
            the first place. So here he is with 2 sessions of MegaMud running 
            kicking each other off<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; every 
            15-20 seconds. Boy did we get a laugh out of that one......</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Tommie meets the High-Druid</FONT></P>
            <P>This happened quite a bit ago when the Elder Grove was added to 
            the game. Tommie a level 15 Paladin, with more sense of adventure 
            than good sense, was exploring the Elder Grove.&nbsp; There had been 
            rumours of a High-Druid, but no one knew exactly where or how to get 
            to him. After awhile she came to a shimmering wall and then an 
            arch.... Now in the back of her mind was that this was gonna be like 
            other areas, a few rooms in size, and that she could check the next 
            room before going in and that way stay out of trouble. 
            Wrong...saying "Go Arch" put her of course in the same room with the 
            High-Druid and in 2 rounds, she was dead. Needless to say she lost 
            all her stuff including a Bone-Handled Headcutter, since no one was 
            high enough to go in and recover it for her</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Tommie and the Ancient Sand Dragon 
            Part 2</FONT></P>
            <P>One day most of the BBS decides to have a Sand Dragon Party. A 
            group of about 15 people level 25-45 or so partied on out there 
            using MegaMud. Now sometime before some Tommies had gotten 
            themselves killed by the Dragon, so it was sitting in the room below 
            just waiting for dinner. Since it was already in that room, we 
            didn't bother to go in the normal way, thus missing the fact that 
            the other Ancient Sand Dragon (the one with about 1 hp) had regened. 
            When everyone was ready we dropped in and began the fight. It was 
            really hard to see what was happening with all the scrolling, but 
            when the dust cleared we had won.... badly hurt most of us, but 
            still alive... Well while everyone was resting since most were below 
            half hp, Tommie decided that she had to leave. Saying bye she climbs 
            out of the pit only to find out the other Sand Dragon was up there 
            and MegaMud was still set to attack. Needless to say this dropped 
            Tommie and another Ancient Sand Dragon down with all of the walking 
            wounded. It wasn't a pretty sight with people dying left and right. 
            As you can imagine Tommie was not very welcome for a while, and in 
            fact, she still hasn't lived this disaster down ;)</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Tommie Goes AFK (Away From 
            Keyboard)</FONT></P>
            <P>The top ten, second place, Tommie, left his script open for 
            remote commands to all users, so a bunch of us made him follow us to 
            the Night Hag cave in Module 2. We opened the door for him, made him 
            kiss us and wave us goodbye, and made him go right inside the cave. 
            We closed the door, and looked East a few times. After a few seconds 
            we saw only his gear on the floor with three bats and one night hag 
            on it. He came back after a few hours and was mad, and its not the 
            end, he had a Sunsword and Elven Silversilk that he had pulled from 
            the demon room on him, so I told a level 16 Mage that the 2 items 
            are in the Night Hag room. The Mage went there thinking he would 
            pick u p the stuff and go back. All he got in the end, was killed in 
            one round.</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Rerolling Tommie</FONT></P>
            <P>Tommie just wasn't very swift some mornings...Tired of being a 
            Ninja, he rerolled to a Paladin. We did not know he rerolled until 
            he came to meet us wearing heavy armour. Someone asked him what 
            happened to the Ninja and he said "reroll", or should I say 
            attempted to say "reroll". Suddenly he left the realm and his stuff 
            was at our feet! He rerolled a level 20 Ninja and ended up a level 
            two or three Paladin after the 2nd reroll.</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Killing Tommie in a Non-PvP 
            Environment</FONT></P>
            <P>When Tommie was little, he enjoyed following folks in gangs to 
            steal experience and being a general nuisance on a regular basis. 
            One day, a gang let him "find" them in Town Square; they then ran to 
            the switch room in the Sewers, near the Mad Wizard. With their 
            Cleric and Paladin dealing out heals, and their Priest doing Major 
            Healing Rains, they pulled the lever 15 times, killing Tommie. It 
            was an amusing death on a non-pvp board.</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Ooops...</FONT></P>
            <P>One time Tommie asked me, being a higher level, for advice. He 
            wanted to know what he should reroll to. I was in a mean mood that 
            day and told him that undoubtedly he should be a Dark-Elf 
            Camel-Rider. Of course we all know that this doesn't exist, but he 
            just decided that he should do what I suggested since I obviously 
            knew more. He rerolled without ever checking to see if it was a real 
            class or not.... you can imagine how angry he was when he paged me 
            from the Menuing System. :)</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Tommie faces the Ancient Sand 
            Dragon</FONT></P>
            <P>One evening, someone decided they didn't like the Ancient 
            Sand-Dragon much. So we were called upon to go murder the poor 
            thing. I (using a level thirty-two Mystic) decided to tag along. We 
            were to meet another group there, and we had just arrived in 
            Khazarad. None of us knew the way, or could be bothered looking at 
            maps.. so Tommie (level forty-six Warrior) decides to lead us with 
            good old MegaMUD. So we arrive one room before it, and everyone was 
            wondering how to get to it. The group we were meant to meet wasn't 
            in the Realm either. We soon figured it out and one by one climbed 
            up. Tommie arrived last, and then proceeds to immediately attack. He 
            had auto-attack on, as well as attack all monsters. Well we put up a 
            good fight, sort of. We got it to slightly wounded when I dropped 
            (and hung). Everyone else in our party died, and some died twice 
            before the day was through... and the items spilled out many rooms 
            away. The dragon didn't drop any chests for our efforts either. The 
            result of maybe ten of the top twenty dying in an hour was needless 
            to say infuriating; not to mention item scabs who had a field day. I 
            was the only person in our group who didn't die (as I had 
            dropped).</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Gender Bending Tommies</FONT></P>
            <P>Some time ago myself (female in and out of Mud) and another 
            player (a guy but playing a female in Mud) started this rumor going 
            that if you chose female over male when creating your character that 
            you got heaps more Intelligence. (Well, its plausible, we know women 
            really have more intelligence than men!) Needless to say, we had a 
            slight gender imbalance in our realm for some time after that.</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Version 1.1 - The Labyrinth</FONT></P>
            <P>When Tommie was a newbie, he made a little Warrior to run around 
            with. He decided he was brave (or dumb) enough to venture into the 
            Labyrinth. He found the Ancient Crypt and found the monsters to be 
            semi-easy. Feeling a little braver he wandered north. Tommie ran 
            across a loaded room and took off running for the exit. When he 
            arrived at the door, he was at about half of his hit points. In his 
            panicked state, he repeatedly bashed the door to escape the 
            following group of monsters. Due to the adrenaline rush to get out, 
            he didn't notice the "You take 2 damage from bashing the 
            door!"...nor did he notice on the last bash it said, "Tommie drops 
            to the ground!" Nothing like bleeding to death, from your own 
            stupidity</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Module 4 - The Brave Little 
            Witchunter</FONT></P>
            <P>One day, Tommie's gang decided to go and kill the Giant 
            Two-Headed Troll. Since they never had any problems killing it, they 
            decided to bring along Tommie, a level 11 Witchunter. When they 
            finally got there, after much complaining from Tommie about how 
            Synterm sucks, they moved to one room outside of the Black Dragon. 
            Then, Tommie tries to "l w" but his terminal program decided to hit 
            enter between "l and w". Next thing Tommie sees is "The black dragon 
            sprays a jet of acid at you for 175 damage!" but not before he took 
            out twenty-one damage with his Mithril Cutlass.</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>The Horned Demon</FONT></P>
            <P>Tommie died in the Horned Demon's room and lost a Bone 
            Handled-Headcutter and the Holy Medallion. Not knowing that he could 
            just pull the lever, grab an item and then pull lever again he got 
            the brilliant idea to die multiple times and fill the room with 
            items so (hopefully) his good stuff would spill out and he could get 
            it. So, he equipped up and ran in. Tommie died several times, losing 
            six lives, and finally managing to spill his stuff out...into the 
            Horned Demon's treasure room.... where it has been ever since. A 
            re-index and floor strip don't recognize them as being in that room 
            or missing of course, so the only way to get them back would be a 
            full reset of the game.</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>Silly PvP Deaths</FONT></P>
            <P>One day this Thief, Tommie, didn't really trust someone who 
            invited him to go somewhere, but he said yes. Tommie was about level 
            twenty-six and the Thief was about level twenty-two. Tommie figured 
            if the Thief<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; BS'ed him, he 
            could just kick his butt. So the Thief brought Tommie to the Slum 
            Gates and, naturally, BS'ed him. Tommie ran and he followed (since 
            they were in a party and he typed follow Tommie). He headed for the 
            bank and realized that the Thief was still following him, so he 
            tried to uninvite him. Trying to think quickly he kept typing 
            "leave" (which didn't work since he was the party leader) and 
            spelling uninvite wrong, and in the meantime got BS'ed seven times 
            and died... one room away from the bank, heavy with lots of good 
            items he had unequipped</P>
            <P><FONT color=#ffcc33 size=4>The Western Outpost</FONT></P>
            <P>One day, Tommie took a group to Commander Markus. The group was a 
            level fifteen Witchunter, a level seven Ranger (Tommie) and another 
            level ten. They got halfway to Markus and Tommie got held and died. 
            They had just spent almost two hours getting to the halfway point 
            because Tommie was using his maps. They waited roughly another hour 
            for him to pick them back up, ...and yes he died again. So, they had 
            to wait even longer. Tommie finally got smart and decided to bring a 
            bodyguard, a level twenty Warrior. They finally got back together, 
            and up to Markus. They asked Tommie what to type and he tells 
            them...nothing happens. Tommie forgot to have them do the prequest 
            and they ended up wasting 5 hours doing nothing</P>

            get some experience and kill some of the larger monsters of the 
            Realm, so Tommie invited him not knowing he wanted me dead. He 
            backstabbed Tommie while he was in Tommie's party, and went Fiend. 
            Well being the idiot that he was he never broke from the party. 
            Where do guards like to hang out? In the bank. Well he managed to 
            get a few BS's off before Tommie realized what happened and then it 
            was just a matter of seconds before Tommie ran into the bank, and 
            watching him get brutally murdered in front of Tommie</P>

            <P>Picture this scene...the Blood Champion had never been killed in 
            this game. A group went down to the Blood Champion, and were waiting 
            outside his room. There were seven people total. They'd just cleared 
            out the rooms and were one West of the Blood Champion, who's sitting 
            alone. Everyone is resting up from fighting a lot of priests and 
            stuff, suddenly Tommie decides he'll do everyone a favor and just 
            walk east and bring the Blood Champion back with him. With some of 
            the party still under half HP, and no powers ready...they were 
            screwed. Everyone fought it out for a bit, and a couple of them ran 
            east and survived. Everyone else died, thanks to Tommie</P>
