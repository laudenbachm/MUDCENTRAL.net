Misfits BBS<br>Telnet: hocalbbs.com
<p>
<p>Hotel California is run by King (Nameless in mud.), the mud playing sysop.  There are also one 
 playing mudop's, Rikki, who is at keys often enough.  Overall this is a medium sized board with 
 talkative and friendly players.  Many of the players I have seen on other boards and quite a few 
 actively read and post in forums. </p>

<p>Hotel California hosts around 14-20 people on average, usually at least 2 at keys.  Upon entering 
 Hocal I was greeted by 10 people, reminder this is a 1 account bbs.  Greetings and friendly 
 hello's were followed by offers to help me gain experience and offerings of equipment and money.  
 When I entered, the board was in the middle of attempting parts of the 5th alignment quest, 
 unfortunatly the Hanging Tree handed them a beat down.  As I gained a couple level's, equipment 
 and limited items were ready and given to me.  The speed of the board was decent, no lag burst 
 but not entirly the greatest connection. The cost of Hocal is $5 a month, $25 for 6 months and a 
 20-day free trial (DEMO) class. PvP is set to 10 levels, but is rarely seen. The top character 
 (Paladin) has around 5.5 billion experience and is followed by a cleric with 4.2 billion.  The 
 TopTen ranges from 800 million to 5.5 billion with no dominant player or gang.  With friendly 
 people, plenty of items and plenty of open places to experience I recommend this place for newer 
 and experienced players who want a break from afk scripters. </p>

<p>I scored Hotel California 8 of 10 - it has plenty of opportunities for players to make 
 characters, gain exp and get those valued limiteds. The score could easily be a 9 or 10 with a 
 larger playerbase and a slightly better connection.  Friendy, Wide-open, Fun and Deadly 5th Quest 
 runs are a few of the words I'd use to describe Hocal. </p>
