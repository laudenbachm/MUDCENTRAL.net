Casrock BBS<br>Telnet: casrock.com<p><p>I had the pleasure of making a visit to Casrock BBS. This is a very small and quiet non-pvp 
realm. There was an average of 6-8 characters online during my stay there (1 dupe per person). 
The mudop, Cyrus, was more than helpful with money, items and experience. This BBS offers sys 
goto and sys map to all players at no additional cost. Being such a small realm, many many of the 
items are still available, there are a large amount of limiteds just waiting to be claimed by 
players. The top 10 is very small, ranging from 50bil down to a mere 9mil exp. The few problems I
found during my stay were spurts of lag,  (not enough to kill me) very quiet gossips, and the BBS
only has a 16 user license for mud. Should the 16 lines fill, dupes will be gotten rid of and it 
will become 1 account per person. The SysOp is very active, logging into the mud at least 3 times 
during my stay to check on players and the realm. He was very easy to get ahold of through e-mail
as well, always responding very quickly.  
</p>
<p>I scored this BBS an 8 out of 10 because of the lag and the very quiet atmosphere. With some new 
and talkative players, this could become a very thriving realm in no time. I recommend this board 
to anyone looking for a friendly, quiet environment where limiteds are never a problem.</p>

Board Rules
------------------

1. No Pvp
 
2. No Death Pile Raiding. There are no exceptions to this. If you have
   a complaint about your death pile being raided and something is
   missing please immediately bring it to the attention of either Cyrus
   or Gutless and we will work quickly to resolve the matter. If a
   person is found having raided a Death Pile they will be suspended for
   one week, 2nd offense is suspension for a month, 3rd strike
   and they are out.
 
3. No intentional stacking of rooms, period!! If you stack a room on
   accident let someone who has the skill to unstack that room know so
   that he/she can. If you are found having done this intentionally,
   then the same punishment applies as above.
 
4. If you have an item that you are not using then that is having lots
   of toys. If you have an item that you are not using and someone
   else needs it and asks you, "Hey do you have (insert item here)" and
   you reply hell no. That is considered hoarding. There will be no
   hoarding on this board.
 
5. For the time being dupes are allowed, with provisions though.
 
 A. Dupe must be payed for in full just like a regular character.
 B. Only 1 dupe per user max.
 C. Remember that we are running the 16 user verison, if we fill up on
     users the the dupes must go. And if one dupe goes everyone's dupe
     goes, no questions asked!!
 
6. Scripting is allowed afk 24/7, but please remember that this is a
   game to be enjoyed live more than just 5 minutes a day. If you have
   time come to the keys and see if anyone else is there too.
 
7. Anytime we do anything major in the game, be it an update or just
   doing a routine room sweep we are going to post it on the entrance to
   Mud and will have a vote on when/where/if to do it. Just remember,
   the Sysop and Mudop have the final say in anything. We are going to
   try and be democratic here but if we must decide on an issue the
   Sysop and Mudop have the ultimate Veto.
 
8. If your account is inactive for over 30 days it becomes the property
   of the BBS and we will use it as we see fit.
