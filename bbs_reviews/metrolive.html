Metro Live<br>Telnet: masterpiece.com
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably one of the most rewarding experiences
 a MajorMUD player can have is to play in a live Realm, where you 
 actively take a role in shaping your character from start to finish. 
 And what better place to play it than on the MajorMUD homebase 
 itself, MetroBBS.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While scripting is certainly allowed, players must always be at the 
 keys.  This is a great boon to both old and new characters alike.  
 For older players, this helps solve the biggest problem high level 
 characters face, boredom.  Though occasionally there are a few 
 moments of silence, many players log in during work breaks or
 otherwise just to chatter, ensuring there is rarely a dull moment.  
 For new players, this means there is practically always going to be 
 someone at keys who can help give advice, or offer assistance with 
 quests and experience.  The atmosphere is very congenial and relaxed,
 all of the players openly express interest in seeing more new faces 
 in the Realm.  There are many high level limiteds available in 
 particular, simply because the board isn't yet big enough as a whole 
 to go out and acquire them.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since all players must be at keys at all times, the Realm population
 may appear to be on the low side.  However, even with only 10 players
 on average in the Realm at any one time, that is comparable to many 
 Realms with 25+ online, when you consider there are no dupes allowed,
 and every single person you see is at keys.  Playing on one of 
 Metro's boards also comes with its perks.  Besides getting to enjoy 
 the occasional online visits of Shannon and IZaK, MajorMUD's core 
 developers, there is also plenty of active sysop support available.  
 What most Metro Live players will boast about is their monthly 
 tournaments.  Whether its Shannon's gibbering horrors and terror 
 beasts testing the player's mettle, or IZaK's triathalons and 
 player's-choice rewards, there is always an event to keep the game 
 fresh and everyone involved.  So get to keys on Metro Live!</p>
