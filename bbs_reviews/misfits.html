Misfits BBS<br>Telnet: misfits.dnsalias.net
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misfits is run by Nity and Erekose, regular posters in the Mudcentral  forums.  This is 
their second BBS, and the popularity of both suggest their fairness and attentiveness.  
Many of the "Who's Who" mudders can often be spotted dallying on Misfits, many who also
have characters on Looniebin.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misfits itself hosts a good number of players, in fact 26 at the time of my logging in, 
which is doubly impressive considering they do not allow any dupes.  Activity is certainly
not in short supply either, as text was rolling off the screen with fast-fingered gossip,
and even a boss run was in progress.  Item availability is also surprisingly good for a 
BBS of that size, with several limiteds being auctioned off even during my brief visit.  
The general atmosphere was friendly and jovial; from the moment I logged on I was being 
invited to participate in their on-going gold jeweled ring tournament.  The board is fairly
established, so several high level players can be found.  The Top Ten, lead by a warrior, 
did not have any substantial gaps or overly dominant gangs.  So, at any level range there 
are people to party, do quests, or script with, and you are not forced to join a certain 
gang just to have access to items or help.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I scored Misfits 10 of 10 - it has plenty of friendly players, loads fast, lims are 
easily obtainable, and sysop support is easy to find.  This is a great place to be if 
you're looking for a BBS with people always at the keys and have no qualms playing in a
governed society.  Don't miss out on Misfits BBS!</p>
