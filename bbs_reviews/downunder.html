Telnet - telnet://downunderbbs.com<br>
Webpage - http://www.downunderbbs.com<p>My two weeks stay at Downunder BBS was very pleasant. The board is located
in Australia, but I had very few problems with any lag during my time there.
The SysOp and the players are all very friendly. The SysOp power leveled me
and gave me plenty of cash and was extremely helpful. The realm is quiet off
and on and has its peak times when it's full of chitter chatter. There are a
lot of limiteds up for grabs, hoarding is watched very closely. This board
has a pvp level of 5, but there is a non-pvp gang which cannot be attacked
under any circumstances. It caters to both pvpers and non-pvpers. There was
an average of 20-25 characters online during my stay, as well as a bot that
the sysop has setup to allow players to check the status of bosses and add
evil points to themselves. If you're looking for a friendly group of players
with a helpful sysop, this is a great board to check out! I gave this board
a 9 out of 10 because it could use a few more players to chatter in gossips
and there is always a tad of lag telnetting from the US to another country.
</p>   Stats: <br>=====================<br>Sysop/Owner - Nicholas Clavell - Plays mud with the users.<br>
His personal BBS accounts are in the "User" class so there's no confusion as to
which characters are his.<br>
The only account with SysOp powers is the SysOp account which is not played.<br>
Mudops - None<br>
Connection - 1500/256k ADSL link (which is actually only roughly 1200/205k due to 
TCP overhead) using a D-Link DSL-504 Modem/Router.<br>
Up and running since October 6th, 2002.<br>
Mods - 1-9 and MajorMud Plus<br>
Top Player - Morpheus SenseiShadow Mystic with 11566064299 experience<br>
Dupe Policy - There is no limit to the number of accounts you can make 
within reason but if the WG Line Count needs to be upgraded the top few users 
with the most accounts will be asked for donations towards it as these extra
lines are quite expensive.<p>
