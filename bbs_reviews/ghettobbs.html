Ghetto BBS<br>Telnet: ghettobbs.dnsalias.net
<p>
Ghetto BBS is ran by Ghettofied. Currently there are two mudops, Kansur and Hagrid whom are at keys often offering a great variety of items.  Quite a few of the players there post or read the forums frequently and have talked about playing on other boards as well.  Ghetto BBS also has an invisible MudBot that keeps timed events going to keep the players up to date on relevant rules and reminders due to whatever issues may arise.</p>
 
<p>This BBS has a more than average active user-base that includes anywhere from 26-32 players at all times.  It has its peak times of immense chit chat, and there is normally always someone at keys even if there is no activity in gossips. Usually, you just have to speak, and someone will respond, which in turn will spark up the rest of the realm.</p>
 
<p>I was invited to the board by a long time friend. Upon entering, I was warmly greeted by many players who at the time were praising the current beta of 1.11o and the long waited regen fix. Despite the many offers of money, equipment, and experience, I decided to stick with myself to get the not-so-often feeling a playing a fresh character, and for the most part; observe.  </p>
 
<p>Ghetto BBS has been up and running since May 2003. It went free to the public just about a month ago that was accompanied by a �non-ganghouse� floor sweep in an effort to attract more users. According to the players, this was indeed a great decision that resulted in what was desired.  Despite the increase of users, there are still many limited items available either being auctioned off for some cold hard cash or simply given away.</p>
 
<p>PvP is not really rampant even though there is a current range of 9 levels which was recently lowered from 20. The top players range from 2.5 billion to 500 million. The top gangs show no significant domination of just one gang. Each gang also easily displays its own style and personality from observations in gossips. There is no gang that displays (willingly) a huge amount of intimidation.</p>
 
<p>I gave Ghetto BBS a score of 8 out of 10. It is a fun, lively atmosphere with a great deal of player interaction. The BBS has a wide spread of players from the well-experienced to the ones that are completely new to MajorMUD.  Help is almost always available either in the form of advice or getting a new player adequately started up. Once the purported sporadic lag issues cease (which is explained by the sysop due to a bad router that is soon to be replaced), I would easily have given the BBS a 9. </p>
