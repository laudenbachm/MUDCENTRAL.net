| These are the holy warriors of the realm. Dedicated to fighting for their |
| deity (which can be good OR evil, take note!), they are serious fighters  |
| with minor priestly powers. They can use any weapon or armour, but prefer |
| swords. The Knights of the King are Paladins, as are many of the          |
| wandering warriors you see patrolling the roads. Most Paladins will       |
| actively help anyone in need, even risking their own lives to save the    |
| ones they aid. Evil Paladins, of course, further their deity's will by    |
| slaying all people not of their own faith, so be wary when meeting a      |
| stranger offering help.                                                   |

<B>Pro's Vs Con's:</B> Call yourself crazy , a sneaking paladin only if you want a really huge exp table but it can be done if you are a dedicated player.
and stealth has its advantages in everything espicially when you can have the ac as well. Like the warriors however you won't sneak well till at least lvl 30.
Try a dark-elf, nekojin or an elf for extra mana and with a paladin you'll need all you can get.
<P><FONT COLOR="#AA00FF">Making a Sneaker</FONT><BR>
<B>Stat Suggestions (In order of raise)</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Health = get this to 60-65 first
<LI>Agility = raise it 10-20, should be easy to to adds little stealth and dodge
<LI>Strength = get to 70, hardest stat of sneakers to raise besides health but most important, improves stealth and bs, besides being able to carry more armour
<LI>Wisdom = 50 Helps a priestly spell casting tremendously
<LI>Intel = raise to 50, improves stealth
<LI>Charm = raise to 50, improves stealth and dodge
<LI>Health = get this 80 for HPS
<LI>Strength = get to 80, hit harder and carry more armour
<LI>Agility = raise to 100, swing more and dodge more, also improve stealth tremendously
<LI>Health = get this max next get lots of hps, Mwhahaha!!!
<LI>Intel = raise to 60, improves stealth
<LI>Charm = raise to 60, improves stealth and dodge
<LI>Agility = raise to 20-10 before max, swing more and dodge more, also improve stealth tremendously
<LI>Strength = get to max, hit harder and carry more armour
<LI>Intel = raise to 80, makes you start crit-ing everwhere and improves stealth
<LI>Charm = raise to 70, improves stealth, and you'll notice you'll get hit much less
<LI>Wisdom = 60-70 or less after lvl 20 your wisdom isn't that important since you'll be able to fight better than cast gstk on something
<LI>Intel = raise to max, makes you start crit-ing everwhere and improves stealth
<LI>Charm = raise to max, improves stealth, and you'll notice you'll get hit much less
<LI>Wisdom = max it if you can after every other stat is maxed first

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>Races:</B></FONT> Human, <FONT COLOR="#00ffFF">Dwarf</FONT>, Gnome, <FONT COLOR="#00ffFF">Half-elf, Half-Orc</FONT>, Half-Ogre, <FONT COLOR="#00ffFF">Kang</FONT>, and Guant<P>

<B>Pro's Vs Con's:</B>Now here is a tank they have spells to back up their hps and the AC as well.
Who needs to sneak when you can walk in and swat dragons like flies. The most obvious race would be a dwarf,
perfect for their high wisdom, but also for the extra enc. You may even get crazy and try to make a half-elf for extra mana.
Rick Fanslow suggests the following, "OK here is the Thing.. you MUST choose at level 0 how your gonna make your
pallie.. your either gonna make a warrior or a priest outta him till around
25th level. The only decent race to choose is dwarf the extra encumberance is worth
everything else." Kang would be a decent second choice.
