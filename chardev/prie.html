| Priests embody the virtue of their deities, be they good or evil. They    |
| channel the power of the gods to cast their spells and are notably        |
| intolerant of Priests of a different faith. Good Priests are welcome in   |
| all cities for their invaluable healing services, and for their spiritual |
| guidance. Evil Priests are universally shunned, for their magical         |
| practices often require human sacrifice. In fact, evil Priest seems to    |
| enjoy these disgusting rites, which only perpetuates the disgust felt for |
| them. Priests wear only robes and use blunt weapons, for good priests do  |
| not wish to kill needlessly, and evil priests do not want the victims to  |
| bleed to death before they can use them.                                  |

Sneaking priests , they sneak and they cast what else could you want :)
they are a worthwhile combination if your not looking for a ton of hps.

<P><FONT COLOR="#AA00FF">Making a Sneaker</FONT><BR>
<B>Stat Suggestions (In order of raise)</B><BR>
<UL>
<li>Health = get this to 80 first 
<li>Agility = raise it 10-20, should be easy to to adds little stealth and dodge 
<li>Strength = get to 60, just enough to carry your armour at light, hardest stat of sneakers to raise besides health, improves stealth and bs, besides being able to carry more armour 
<li>Willpower = 80 Helps a priestly spell casting tremendously 
<li>Intel = raise to 50, improves stealth 
<li>Charm = raise to 50, improves stealth and dodge 
<li>Health = get this to MAX next, get lots of hps, Mwhahaha!!! 
<li>Wisdom = MAX for better spellcasting and Mres 
<li>Agility = raise to MAX, swing more and dodge more, also improve stealth tremendously 
<li>Intel = raise to 80, makes you start crit-ing everwhere and improves stealth 
<li>Charm = raise to 80 or less, improves stealth, and you'll notice you'll get hit much less 
<li>Intel = raise to max helps spell casting as well as mana regen and critting 
<li>Charm = raise to max help everything espicially stealth and dodge 
<li>Strength = only keep enough to carry your equipment but raise this all the way up if it is your last stat to raise its all you have left :)

<B>Pro's Vs Con's:</B> Dwarf would be the race to go for a priest,
 for one they start with the highest wisdom, night vision and extra 
enc to carry all kinds of stuff. 
Or you might pick a gnome to gain the ability to pick locks.
