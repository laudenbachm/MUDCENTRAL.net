| Witchunter                                                      EXP: 130% |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Witchunters are a breed of elite warriors who have taken a vow to destroy |
| all magical enemies. They will use no magical weapons, armour or items,   |
| and will only grudgingly accept beneficial spells being cast on them.     |
| They are trained from birth to be ferocious and efficient fighters, and   |
| will give no quarter when faced with an enemy spell-caster. During their  |
| training to become Witchunters they develop a strong anti-magic aura,     |
| which interferes with spells being cast on them. This is due to their     |
| near-fanatical focus and their strong willpower. They will use any non-   |
| magical weapon, but will wear no armour heavier than Scale because they   |
| favour quick, complex attacks that heavy armour will not permit.          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| HP/Level: 6-10  Magic: None   Combat: 5   Weapons: Any    Armour: Scale   |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Abilities: Extra Magic Resistance, No Magic Items.                        |

<B>Pro's Vs Con's:</B>If you want to add a little excitement and a challenge
to your witchunter make them a sneaker. Honestly they won't sneak all
that great till they start to reach higher levels. You might even get
a funny looks and comments by admitting that your a sneaking witchunter.
But stealth in the vortex has a huge advantage over the non sneakers,
let alone the back stabs at higher levels that can kill off most spell casters
weg, and thats what being a witchy is all about. Mwhahahahahaaa!!!! Right Cecil & Smoke.
Best choices are Dark-elf, or Nekojin.



<P><FONT COLOR="#AA00FF">Making a Sneaker</FONT><BR>
<B>Stat Suggestions (In order of raise)</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Health = get this to 70 first
<LI>Agility = raise it 10-20, should be easy to to adds little stealth and dodge
<LI>Strength = get to 80, hardest stat of sneakers to raise besides health but most important, improves stealth and bs, besides being able to carry more armour
<LI>Intel = raise to 50, improves stealth, and crits
<LI>Charm = raise to 50, improves stealth, crits and dodge
<LI>Health = max this next, get lots of hps, Mwhahaha!!!
<LI>Agility = raise to 90 or so, swing more and dodge more, also improve stealth tremendously
<LI>Strength = max it, hit harder and carry more armour
<LI>Intel = raise to 100 or max, makes you start crit-ing everwhere and improves stealth
<LI>Agility = max this
<LI>Charm = raise to 90, improves stealth, and you'll notice you'll get hit much less
<LI>Wisdom = raise this only after every stat is at least 80

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>Races:</B></FONT> Human, <FONT COLOR="#00ffFF">Dwarf</FONT>, Gnome, Half-elf, <FONT COLOR="#00ffFF">Half-Orc</FONT>, Half-Ogre, <FONT COLOR="#00ffFF">Kang</FONT>, and Guant<P>

<B>Pro's Vs Con's: </B>Do you like stomping on the local mages and
having priests for breakfast while laughing in their face. Some of the easiest
characters to build are non sneaking witchies they level faster than
almost any other character. With lots of HP and pure fighting power witchies are a deadly combination.
You don't have to worry about limited items and you can fight better than anyone.
Or if you just want to have an excuse to terrorize the realm.


<P><FONT COLOR="#AA00FF">Making a Tank (non sneaking)</FONT><BR>
<B>Stat Suggestions (In order of raise)</B><BR>
<UL>
<li>Health to 80 to start, as well as Strength as high as you can get it with your remaining cp.  Hitpoints and accuracy are your friend.
<li>Agility to at least 50.
<li>Strength to 90 for combat effectiveness, and the ability to carry better armor.
<li>Agility to at least 65,  so you can get more swings
<li>Wisdom, Charm and Intellect to at least 50 so you aren�t penalized for having any under strength stats. This should all be possible by around 17-20th level, depending on race.
<li>Now raise Health to at least 100, you�ll start resting more effectively, and you�ll start actually needing those hitpoints.
<li>Strength can now go to racial maximum � you�ll need to hit harder and more accurately to take on tougher monsters.
<li>Agility should go to at least 80 now, as it has a strong impact on your swings, and some impact on accuracy.  Smash will probably start to get stale for anything but a Half-Ogre around now.  Consider this preparation to start swinging.
<li>Health can now go to whatever your racial maximum is.  You�ll notice much higher average hitpoint rolls once your health is at maximum.
<li>Agility should now go to racial maximum.
<li>Charm should go to racial max next.
<li>Wisdom and Intellect can be raised as you wish now.  Intellect has a dubious effect on crits and a definite effect on perception.  Wisdom is the determining stat of your magic resistance.  Some players may choose to raise Wisdom earlier.
