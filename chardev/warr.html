| Warriors are the basic front-line fighters in any party. They are able to |
| use any weapons and wear any armour, and have good Combat and Hit Points. |
| Even though they are a basically simple class, they are quite effective   |
| and can be varied: Warriors are guardsmen, mercenaries, infantry, bowmen, |
| gladiators, and a multitude of other professions. They have no magical    |
| powers but can use any magical weapon or armour piece they can find, as   |
| well as all the standard potions.                                         |

<B>Pro's Vs Con's:</B> If you want to add a little excitement and a challenge
to your warrior make them a sneaker. Honestly they won't sneak all
that great till they start to reach higher levels. In the end, however,
they make some of the bester exploring warriors vs the non-sneakers. Imagine
being able to move though any terrian without detection and out of harms
way. And those Back stabs start to come in handy around level 30. 
Best choices are Dark-elf, lower exp table, Elf, or Neokjin.
You will be laughed at in the arena and take a little longer to level than the non sneakers but
once you get to level 25 then you will know why you picked a sneaker vs a non sneaker. 
Imgine getting even with a Bs for 200+.

<B>Stat Suggestions (In order of raise)</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Health = get this to 80 first
<LI>Agility = raise it 10-20, should be easy to to adds little stealth and dodge
<LI>Strength = get to 80, hardest stat of sneakers to raise besides health but most important, improves stealth and bs, besides being able to carry more armour
<LI>Intel = raise to 50, improves stealth, and crits
<LI>Charm = raise to 50, improves stealth, crits and dodge
<LI>Health = max this next, get lots of hps, Mwhahaha!!!
<LI>Agility = raise to 100, swing more and dodge more, also improve stealth tremendously
<LI>Strength = max it, hit harder and carry more armour
<LI>Intel = raise to 100, makes you start crit-ing everwhere and improves stealth
<LI>Agility = max this
<LI>Charm = raise to 90, improves stealth, and you'll notice you'll get hit much less
<LI>Wisdom = raise this only after every stat is at least 80 not important to warriors besides Magic Resistance
</UL>

Race: Dark-Elf    Exp: 710147192       
Class: Warrior    Level: 51            
Hits:   468/571   Armour Class:  61/4  

Strength:  90     Agility: 120
Intellect: 120    Health:  90
Willpower: 30     Charm:   99

Perception:     94
Stealth:       114
Martial Arts:   54
MagicRes:       52

It might have been better to go
with 90 charm and more wisdom 
to at least 50 other than that
this character rules!
</PRE>

<B>Note:</B> Once you get to lvl 45 your stealth will really be in full effect but only count on having 110 stealth fully armoured.

<B>Pro's Vs Con's:</B>
Over all warriors that don't sneak should carry lots of armour to make up for the lack of stealth.
They usually on the average have more hps than their sneaking counter parts and are stronger with higher AC.
They are some of the easiest characters to build up in the beginning but make for a little bit of boredom in higher lvls.
Best choices are Dwarf, Kang and Half-Orc. 
Having to live without lanterns, is it really worth it? You decide.
