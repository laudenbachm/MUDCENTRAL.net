����������������������������������������������������������������������������͹
� Half-Ogres are the offspring of an Orc and an Ogre. No-one really knows,   �
� or wants to know how this comes about. They are about seven feet tall,     �
� and are quite hairless. Their bodies are nearly all muscle, and their      �
� strength is unmatched for creatures their size. Unfortunately, they have   �
� all the cunning and tact of a six-year-old-human, and the coordination of  �
� a drunk. Half-Ogres have a rash temper, but are easily distracted, and so  �
� if you are careful it is possible to avoid conflict with one. Many store-  �
� owners have Half-Ogre workers, for they can work tirelessly and can lift   �
� hundred-pound barrels with ease. They have neither the near-berserk fury   �
� of Ogres, nor the animal intelligence of Orcs, but have a simple kind of   �
������������������������������������ͻ personality which is almost pitiable. �
� Statistics         Abilities       � They are not truly evil, but are      �
������������������������������������͹ frequently exploited due to their     �
� Strength  70-150 � Toughness+2     � stupidity. Half-Ogres are almost      �
� Agility   20-60  � HP/Level+1      � exclusively Warriors. Due to their    �
� Health    60-150 � MagicRes+15     � lack of focus, they cannot learn Kai  �
� Intellect 20-60  � No Kai Forms    � skills, but can learn powers. All     �
� Willpower 25-70  �                 � are quite resistant to hostile magic. �
� Charm     25-60  �                 � A powerful, but extremely slow race.  �

<p><font color="#0000ff"><b>Favorable Classes:</b></font> 
<font color="#00ffff">Witchunter (primary), Warrior, Mage (at high levels)</font>, Ninja
</p>


<B>Pro's Vs Con's:</B><br>
A Half-Ogres pro's are quite easy to see. Godlike 
strength and constitution make them a truly formidable 
foe no matter what class you pick. However picking the 
right class can definitely make a difference. The rest 
of their stats being so low can seriously cripple an up 
and coming mage or druid who rely heavily upon their 
spellcasting, yet some will argue that half-ogres 
weren't meant to focus on that anyway. If you are a 
truly determined person, the hitpoints and damage bonus 
gained from the Half-Ogre may just carry you to high 
levels where eventually your spellcasting will level 
out anyway.

<p><B>Stat Suggestions (In order of raise)</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Level 1: Leave stats at base except for health which goes to 100. HalfOgre needs as many hitpoints as 
possible starting from level 1. This will get you a great start.
<LI>Level 2: Take strength to 80 to help carry the bhhc or maul you'll be bashing with till level 10.
<LI>Levels 3-12: Max Agility. This will help your accuracy while bashing and give you the precious little bonus to 
swings.
<LI>Levels 12-17: Max Charm. This will also help increase your accuracy while swinging or bashing as well as give 
you the precious little bonus to critical hits.
<LI>Levels 17-18: Take Strength to 90. This will help again with weapons, armour, and possibly get you a little 
more swing.
<LI>Levels 19-21: Take Health to 110. You're Half-Ogre remember? Bonus to hitpoints all the way.
<LI>Levels 22-26: Max Intellect. This will get you accuracy bonus to swings, you'll FINALLY be able to find that 
hidden item you left in your hide spot, and you'll get another small increase to critical hits.
<LI>Willpower: At this point feel free to do as you wish with willpower, if you're a priest you might want to 
take the opportunity to max this, however witchunters will probably want to stave off for a while so they can 
focus more on strength and health and hopefully get healed by their buddies every once and a while.
<LI>Strength and Health: At this point you're just going to continue adding to these stats starting with strength. 
I'd recommend adding 10 to each stat evenly, and always add to health first. The more you add to strength, the 
better you'll be able to swing your weapons, and you'll see that even though you may not be swinging straight 
5's with your weapon, many times you'll be doing just as much damage as your little dwarven companion 
(probably more).
</ul>
<p>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Basic Weapon Suggestions:</B></FONT>
<ul>
<li>LvL 1-10 (always bash): Bone-handled Headcutter, maul, club.
<li>LvL +11: The best thing to do is to test out weapons as you go. With the amount of limited items usually taken 
in the game you kinda just have to go with what you can get. Remember, when you test out a weapon, try it both 
bashing and just straight swinging. You may just find the same weapon works completely different in two 
different areas when bashing or swinging. Also, just because a weapon does more damage, doesnt mean it's 
better. Sometimes a little bit lighter weapon is better than the big daddy you just leveled high enough to use.
</ul>
<p>

<FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>Basic Armour suggestions:</B></FONT>
<ul>
<li>LvL 1-10: At this point it doesn't much matter. Wear the 
best armour you can without going heavy.
<li>LvL +11: Same suit follows, though you may find at 
higher levels that being heavy really isn't all that big 
a deal when you're AC is off the charts. And by the 
time you max out Strength, you may not be heavy at all!
</ul>
