| Bards are the wandering entertainers of the realm, travelling from city   |
| to city while playing songs of merriment and bringing information. In     |
| that last respect, Bards are very important: few people travel far, and   |
| for some places Bards are the only source of outside information. Thus,   |
| they are often warmly greeted and usually stay free of charge at any      |
| place they frequent. Bards are trained in exclusive colleges, where they  |
| are taught a multitude of things, from swordplay, to stealth, to magic.   |
| Bards practise a unique form of magic by using their considerable musical |
| talents to weave spells. These spells usually take the form of charming   |
| magic. They can only use one-handed weapons, as they disdain heavy, slow  |
| weapons, and will wear only leather armour.                               |

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>Races:</B></FONT> Elf, Nekojin, Dark-elf, Halfling <P> 
<B>Pro's Vs Con's:</B> Elf and Dark-elf are some of the best sneaking bards to go
with followed closely by the Nekojin.  Goblins work great for a lower cost,
even balanced characters.  The halfling will be able to dodge more but won't
really pay off till the higher levels.  When it comes to damage with the
bards, the Dark-elf seems to deal out the most damage where the Elf ties for
first after level 50+; Neko is a very close second.  Any of the sneaking 
races would be great for a bard.

<B>Stat Suggestions (In order of raise)</B><BR>
        <UL>
<li>Health = get this to 60 right off the bat.
<li>Agility = get this to 60 or 70 as soon as possible, more swings and better dodge in combination with the higher charm levels.
<li>Strength = get this to 50 for a decent encumbrance so you can start wearing rigid leather and carry heavier weapons.
<li>Charm = if you start with 50, raise it 10 more as soon as you get the chance.
<li>Intellect = get this to 60 for a good balance and so you start critting more.
<li>Willpower = leave this at base unless you plan on PVP'ing, work on this later.
<li>Health = Raise to 70.
<li>Strength = Raise to 60.
<li>Agility = Raise to 80.
<li>Health = Raise to 80 (or max it).
<li>Charm = Increase it by 10, if you started at 50, 75 is good else 70.
<li>Agility = Raise it to 90.
<li>Strength = Raise it to 70.
<li>Intellect = Raise it to 70-75.
<li>Agility = Get this to 100 asap.  Should be there by level 22/23.
<li>Charm = Increase to 80.
<li>Itellect = Raise this to 90.
<li>Health = If you health isn't maxxed out yet, do so at this point.
<li>Charm = Increase to 90.
<li>Strength = If this is not already maxxed out, increase this to 80.
<li>Intellect = Increase to 100.
<li>Agility = Max it.
<li>Strength = Max it.
<li>Charm = Max it.
<li>Intellect = Max it.
<li>Health = Max it.

Much like the Mystics, the non-sneaking races don't suffer
from the heavy exp table but also don't deal much in the way of backstabbing
either until higher levels.  The Dwarf is one of the best for the high
strength and health as well as additional magic resistance and encumbrance 
not to mention the night vision.  The Half-elf would also be a good choice with
the additional mana and higher charm, agility, and intelligence.  Gaunt 
might make an interesting bard based on the intelligence alone, potentially the 
best choice for a PVPing bard class.
