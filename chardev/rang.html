| Rangers are the hunters and protectors of the wilderness, along with the  |
| Druids. They will never wilingly harm an animal, but will fight in self-  |
| defense if necessary. Rangers share the same attitudes as the Druids in   |
| respect to what they believe in, and in fact, Rangers are just more       |
| adventurous and militant Druids. Some unscrupulous Rangers use their      |
| abilities for man-hunting, at which they excel. All of them practice some |
| form of druidic magic, and this combined with their formidable combat     |
| abilities and their stealth makes them powerful characters. Rangers are   |
| excellent sneakers and can plan an ambush quite well if it is necessary.  |
| They wear only leather armour, for they need stealth and mobility to      |
| employ their powers, but they will use any weapon. Overall, Rangers are   |
| a powerful and expensive class.                                           |

        <P>

<B>Pro's Vs Con's:</B> Since rangers are sneakers by default,
why not just keep them that way with a sneaking class. They start with
higher stealth and their bs's are usually harder hitting.

<P><FONT COLOR="#AA00FF">Making a Sneaker</FONT><BR>
<B>Stat Suggestions (In order of raise)</B>
<UL>
<LI>Strength = 60 (for bigger weapons (like katana)</LI>
<LI>Agility = Get it to at least 70</LI>
<LI>Health = Now you can raise this to 80 if you want, it will take a good deal of lvls, but be worthwhile when done</LI>
<LI>Agility = Pump it to 80</LI>
<LI>Charm = Raise to 50</LI>
<LI>Wisdom = Raise to 50 about the same time as charm</LI>
<LI>Agility = 100 (as a sneaker using fast low damage weapons, agil helps a lot)</LI>
<LI>Strength = You should have 80 by level 25 or earlier, depending on how you built your character.</LI>
<LI>Health = 95, more hps</LI>
<LI>Intel = 80 (more crits, ect)</LI>
<LI>Strength = 100 (so you can play with all the toys your warrior friends have been for the past 8 lvls)</LI>
<LI>Now you can pretty much do whatever you want, up intel, but don't forget charm or wis (charm moreso, it does a little bit of everything)</LI>

        <P> <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>Races:</B></FONT> Half-elf, Gnome, Dwarf, 
          Half-orc
        <P>

<B>Pro's Vs Con's:</B> Rangers can only use leather. You can't
really make a tank out of a ranger. Although a bit harder to do, stats (like health)
are higher at base lvls and can be easier if you don't want to try and
bs. Also, tankly classes can be chaeaper in the exp department and
will (could) end up just as well in the end if done correctly. Dwarf is a good choice as well as Kang.

<P><FONT COLOR="#AA00FF">Making a Tank (non sneaker)</FONT><BR>
<B>Stat Suggestions (In order of raise)</B>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+1>LVL 1 Stats</FONT>
<LI>Health = Get this to 80 right away
<LI>Agility = Try for at least 50
<LI>Strength = Pump it to 60 right away, shouldn't cost much as a dwarf. gnome
I would put it to 60 by lvl 8 or so
<LI>Intel = Dwarves need not apply til at least lvl 8, gnomes could raise it
to 50 at 1</LI>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+1>AFTER LVL 1</FONT></LI>
<LI>Agility = Raise this to 65 or 70</LI>
<LI>Intel = Raise to 50 (if not done yet) Same with wisdom</LI>
<LI>Strength = Up to 80 (if a dwarf)</LI>
<LI>Agility = 80&nbsp;</LI>
<LI>Health = 95 if a Dwarf, maybe even a gnome</LI>
<LI>Strength = 80 if not done yet</LI>
<LI>Intel = 65</LI>
<LI>Agility = 100</LI>
<LI>Intel = 80</LI>
<LI>Strength = 100</LI>
</UL>
Now you can pretty much do whatever you want, charm could be upped, it
helps everything.

<CENTER><B>Notes About Rangers</B><BR></CENTEr>
<UL>
<LI>Spellcasting comes with time, stick with it and get just enough sc in the lower lvls to keep yourself casting mend and rhel ok.
<LI>Rhel is a godsend spell. It is what makes rangers such good scripters, no other sneakers can script (or survive) as well.
<LI>Pvp is something rangers excell at. They have better hps than ninjas, can bs just as well, and should have decent crits at higher lvls too. Tracking can be useful, but can be done without.
<LI>Rangers are expensive in terms of exp. My ranger have high exp tables, but they also makes 115k/hr at lvl 32, which not many classes could do.
<LI>Stick with it and have fun, resisit the reroll urge.
