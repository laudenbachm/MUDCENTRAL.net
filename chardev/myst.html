| Mystics are a rare and unusual class. They are the students of ancient    |
| unarmed combat arts, and develop considerable mental powers (called Kai   |
| powers) in the course of their training. The source of these Mystics is   |
| not well known, but it is generally assumed to be an ancient teacher in   |
| some secluded cave. Of course, this Mystic teacher could live right in a  |
| city for all that is known. There are fairly advanced disciples in most   |
| cities, and they teach these exotic skills to any they deem worthy. They  |
| have yet to divulge the location of their master, however. Mystics'       |
| unarmed combat is effective against weapons and armour due to their       |
| knowledge of critical points. Usually use no weapons at all, but some     |
| have become proficient in the staff. They will wear no armour except for  |
| robes, as speed is the main element of their art.                         |

<p><font color="#0000ff"><b>Races:</b></font> <font color="#00ffff">Dark-elf, Elf</font>, Halfling, Goblin, <font color="#00ffff">Nekojin</font></p>

<p><b>Pro's Vs Con's:</b>The exp chart for a sneaking mystic is higher than for a non-sneaker, but the dodge and damage will more than make up for it. In terms of damage, Elf ranks the highest,
followed closely by Dark-Elf, and then Nekojin. Goblin and Halfling have excellent hitpoints, but their low strength just doesn't quite cut it--they need those extra hitpoints because it takes them
longer to make the kill. You really cannot go wrong with a Mystic, regardless of which race you pick (except Half-Ogre), but sneaking races do have the extra intelligence and agility that greatly
help Mystics, and that's why many players prefer sneakers.</p>

<b>Stat Suggestions (In order of raise)</b><br>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Health = get it to 60 fairly early on and then leave it alone for a while.. You have swan to help you out</li>
<li>Strength = get it to 50 and then leave it.. You wear silk, so you don't need much at first</li>
<li>Agility = get it to 60 quickly, to give you speed and dodge</li>
<li>Intellect = get it to 60, for crits</li>
<li>Charm = get it to 60, for dodge and crits</li>
<li>Willpower = leave it at base, unless you pvp a lot.. if you do, raise it periodically to 70 or so</li>
<li>Agility = raise it to 90</li>
<li>Health = raise it to 70</li>
<li>Intel = raise it to 70</li>
<li>Charm = raise it to 70</li>

<li>Agility = raise it to 110</li>
<li>Health = raise it to 80</li>

<li>Agility = max it out (unless you're a Halfling.. then stop at 120 or 130)</li>
<li>Intel = raise to 90</li>
<li>Charm = raise to 90</li>
<li>Health = max it out (unless it is already)</li>

<p><font color="#0000ff"><b>Races:</b></font> Human, <font color="#00ffff">Dwarf, Gnome, Half-elf,</font> Half-Orc, Half-Ogre, Kang, and Gaunt</p>

<p><b>Pro's Vs Con's:</b> Non-sneakers will have a lower exp chart, and more hitpoints (except for Gaunt Ones), but their dodge and damage will be lower than a sneaker's. After level 27, you can do
the stealth quest, and being a non-sneaker will have no effect on your stealth... only on your combat. No matter which race you pick, as long as you pick something you want, you will have fun with
it. Gnome is a great choice, because of the picklocks. Human is pretty interesting, because all of the stats are even, and Dwarf is good for the hitpoints and extra magic resistance.</p>
