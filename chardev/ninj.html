| well in hand to hand combat, they prefer to immobilize their opponent     |
| before he would have time to react. After a deadly attack from the        |
| shadows, they will usually finish off their victim with their mastery of  |
| pressure point attacks. The ninjas of Silvermere have been rumoured to be |
| in league with the thieves guild, and are usually hired by them to do the |

<B>Pro's Vs Con's: </B>
The opinion: Sneaking around and 
beating things up is what ninjas do best.  
Having stealth, picklocks and traps will make 
you a desired companion in any party.  Stealth 
helps out a lot for getting places and retrieving gear 
(ninjas are fairly weak without a weapon) and of course 
it allows for backstabbing, which is very useful at lower 
levels.  Anyway, elf is the champ with killer intellect, 
charm, and good agility.  Granted, agility is the paramount 
stat for a ninja, but having adequate charm and intellect to 
back that is crucial.  Elf has the best mix of these, with 
dark-elf as an acceptable alternative.  However, dark-elves, 
the higher chart of the pair, do not max stats until level 62, 
while elves do at 56, they�re more expensive.  Of course, 
dark-elves do have a pointless accuracy bonus (may be useful 
in the future) and half a percent bonus on crits.  Nekojins 
follow suit behind the elves with a trump agility but loser 
intellect and weaker charm, tracking isn�t a bonus here.  
Halfings are a different style of ninja, the 150 agility will 
almost offset the lack of intellect or charm, but their loser 
strength will prevent you from wielding stronger weapons efficiently.  
Crit enough, however, and that won�t matter.

<B>Stat Suggestions (In order of raise)</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Health = get it to 50.  Get used to having lower hitpoints, but this won�t matter because you�ll be dodging enough stuff.
<LI>Strength = Get this to 50, leave it here for quite a while.
<li>Agility = Get this to 80 as soon as you can, plan on raising this stat a lot.
<li>Charm = bring this to 60, you�re going to need all the dodge you can get.
<li>Intel = always follow a raise of charm with a raise of int.
<li>Wisdom = This is your loser stat.  I have seen level 50 ninjas with base willpower, get it to 50 when you�re bored, usually in the 20s or 30s depending on where you exp.
<li>Agility = Get this to 90.
<li>Health = raise it to 60. 
<li>Charm = raise it to 70 
<li>Intel = raise it to 70
<li>Agility = raise it to 100
<li>Health = raise it to 70  
<li>Charm = raise it to 80 
<li>Intel = raise it to 80 
<li>Strength = raise it to 60
<li>Agility = raise it to 110
<li>Health = raise it to 80
<li>Charm = raise it to 90
<li>Intel = raise it to 90
<li>Agility = max it out (unless you're a Halfling.. then stop at 120 or 130)
<li>Strength = raise it to 70 You�re probably needing it for higher end weapons about now.
<li>Charm = raise to 100 
<li>Intel = raise to 100 
<li>Health = max it out (unless it is already)
<li>Stats that MUST BE MAXED AT EXP CAP, Agility, Charm, Health, Intel doesn�t have to be.  
Lots of people dump the cps for the last 5 points of intellect into wisdom so their 
MR isn�t horrid.  I always max strength (ninjas are a combat class, you know) 
but that�s not a necessity.In other words:  
You�re basing everything off agility.  Keep it 20 higher 
(at least) than the charm/int combo, and raise those two evenly by 10, 
always charm first (it�s a better stat than intellect).  
Health and strength are raise as needed stats, they both are dependent 
on your weapon selection, encumberance issues, and how much undodgable damage 
is coming your way.  Wisdom is much the same

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>Races:</B></FONT> Human, Dwarf, Gnome, <FONT COLOR="#00ffFF">Half-elf, Half-Orc</FONT>, Half-Ogre, <FONT COLOR="#00ffFF">Kang</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR="#00ffFF">Guant</FONT><P>

<B>Pro's Vs Con's: </B>
The opinion:  Right, sacrificing stealth can do two things.  
Your exp chart will drop significantly no matter which race you choose.  
Half-elves and humans both retain tolerable mixes of agil/int/charm 
which are the backbone of a traditional ninja.  Essentially then, 
you�re putting off sneaking until level 27.  The other route to go 
with a nonsneaker is to abandon both dodge and crits in favor of max 
damage and thick hitpoints.  Half-ogre is the extreme in this case, 
and a player I respect quite a bit has an effective higher-end one 
running around.  Yes, it�s goofy, that much is obvious.  Dwarf is 
a more conservative choice in the same manner, having extra MR is 
rather nice because wisdom is going to be a low stat for any ninja.  
I will mention kang also, which is a weaker dwarf except for the 
poison immunity and extra AC that will come in handy.

<P><FONT COLOR="#AA00FF">Making a Tank (non sneaking)</FONT><BR>
<B>Stat Suggestions (In order of raise)</B><BR>
<UL>
<li>Agility = get it to 50. Anything less is a joke.
<li>Charm = get it to 50.
<li>Intel = get it to 50.
<li>Wisdom = still the loser stat.  Raise only when needed to 50.
<li>Strength = get this to 70.  It�s fun
<li>Health = get this it 70.  Run this stat evenly with strength on raises.
<li>Agility = get it to 60
<li>Charm = get it to 60 
<li>Intel = get it to 60
<li>Agility = actually, get it to 80.  You�ll have enough strengh and health for a while.
<li>Health = get this to 80.  You�re going to need hitpoints to make up for the lack of dodge.
<li>Strength = get this to 80.  You�ll need this to make up for the lack of crits.
<li>Charm = bring this to 70
<li>Intel = bring this to 70
<li>Agility = max this
<li>Health = bring this to 90
<li>Strength = bring this to 90
<li>Charm = max this
<li>Intel = max this
<li>Keep raising health and strength evenly until they are maxed
<li>STATS THAT MUST BE MAXED AT EXP CAP, Agility, Charm, Strength, Health. Again, same principle concerning intellect.
In other words:  Build this character the same as a sneaker, in the early levels, but take advantage of the cheap cp boosts in health and strength.  Once your dodge stats are maxed out, then it�s health and strength to the roof.  These stats are much more important now than in a sneaking ninja.  Wisdom as needed again.  You�ll end up with something like a warrior, that crits more.  Maybe.
