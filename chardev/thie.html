| The Thief class is fairly self-explanatory. Thieves steal, for different  |
| reasons, and are very good at it. Not all thieves rob for personal gain:  |
| many are vigilantes, robbing sleazy nobles to help the poor. Others       |
| rarely use their thieving skills and are basically scouts, creeping ahead |
| to survey enemies. Of course most thieves rob for their own benefit, and  |
| thus it is usually good to keep an eye on all Thieves in your party, even |
| if they have given their word they will not rob you. Thieves have a       |
| number of useful abilites, including Thievery, Stealth, Lockpicking,      |
| and Traps. They can use any one-handed weapon, and will wear no armour    |
| greater than leather due to their need for stealth. Thieves can           |
| also Backstab from the shadows when they are hidden, as can any class     |
| with Stealth.                                                             |

<P><FONT COLOR="#AA00FF">Making a Tank (non sneaking)</FONT><BR>
<p>I'd like to advise heavily against making a tank thief. The low hitpoint base and combat-2 makes it near impossible to achieve making a tank well enough. Not to mention the lack of stealth at lower levels will hurt considerably and probably won't make for a very fun character in the beginning levels. If you ARE going to make a tanker thief, the only class you should go with is Half-Ogre. It's +1 to HPs per level and sheer strength alone make up for the problems you'll suffer from being a low level. The problems with Half-Ogre and thieves are apparent as they get lowly capped agil, int, and charm which are the main stats a thief needs.</p>
