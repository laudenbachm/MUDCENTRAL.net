| Druids are the traditional protectors of the forest. They worship and     |
| revere all forms of wildlife and nature. They are usually solitary folk,  |
| each keeping watch of a different part of the wilderness, but in times of |
| need they come forth to preserve the balance of nature. Normally they are |
| quite pacifistic, and avoid combat, but when the balance of things is in  |
| danger or their wilderness is threatened, they will retaliate with force. |
| Druids command substantial magics, and will not hesitate to use them in   |
| the process of cleansing their lands from intruders. Druids use only      |
| blunt weapons as they find bloodshed distasteful, but if they are caught  |
| unaware they will use their sickles to defend themselves. They will wear  |
| only natural armour. The Druids and the Rangers are very close, and they  |
| often consult each other on the ways of the world.                        |

<p><b>Pros Vs Cons:</b> Pros Vs Cons: Being able to sneak though the forest has its advantages
and when your dealing with a poorly armoured class, a sneaker is the way to
go. Think sneak, backstab, fist, fury or silverwood staff them to death if
you're one of the lucky ones. Backstabbing is also a very mana conserving
tactic, which helps make up for the druid's lower mana regen of the magic 3
classes. Best choice in order of best to worst it: Goblin, Elf, Dark-Elf,
Nekojin, Halfling.
<br>

<p><font color="#aa00ff">Making a Sneaker</font><br>
<b>Stat Suggestions (In order of raise)</b><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Health = 65 minimum for survival.  raise it to 70 my 25th maxe it by 35th You'll need the HP.
<li>Agility = 60 is a good start if possible but you will not have the mana regen or spellcasting to keep up your casting you WILL have to fight if you are solo. You will also need this stat for sneaky and backstabbing crits and dodge.  80 Will go along way til like 40th lvl and above.
<li>Strength = Druid weapons are blunt therefore are heavier than normal bladed weapons you will need 60+ strength to weild anything better than a staff or small mace. If you wish to use a staff you will still probably need 60 strength to carry you gear at a playing weight class.
<li>Intel = Intellect is half you primary casting stat, keep your willpower and intellect balanced but dont spend 4cp of willpower if u can spend 2 or 3 on int and get more. in other words raising 5 intellect is better than raising 3 willpower but don't disreguard either stat you will need both.
<li>Wisdom =Read the above for info on this stat.
<li>Charm = Charm = Dodge almost nothing more from this stat make it yur final stat but keep a minimum of 50 or u suffer badly on you ability to sneak and dodge. charm = Luck
</ul>

Half-Orc, Half-Ogre, Kang, <font color="#00ffff">Guant</font></p>

<p><b>Pros Vs Cons:</b> 
Pros Vs Cons: Non sneaking druids will be your battle druids. They will
eventually be stronger and healthier giving them an edge later on.
However, without the benefit of stealth, they will be a little more challenging
to build up. Tank classes mainly benefit from higher hit points but will
have a ALOT trouble getting through the snake pit in mod 7.
Best choices are Gnome and Dwarf (these two races have good health and
all around stats for balancing a warrior druid. Kangs also are good, more
willpower and added Armor Class)
<br>


<p><font color="#aa00ff">Making a Tank (non sneaker)</font><br>
<b>Stat Suggestions (In order of raise)</b><br>
</p>

<ul>
<LI>Health = 80 as soon as you start if you can have it.  Your Hp is one of your major advantage to warrior druids.
<LI>Agility = Is another stat you will need alot of.  this is a stat most tank druid have a tough time raising because most tank races start with 30 agility or so. You need 80 agility to swing most weapons affectively so do the best you can to get there as fast as you can.
<LI>Strength = start out at 60 but get to 70 as soon as its affordable. Gear can be heavy and lack of strength can slow you down due to lack of encumberance. later on the good weapon need 80-90 strength so be aware of this stat to fits yur needs based on gear level restrictions.
<LI>Intellect = To crit you need intellect which is ok because you also need this stat to cast raise it evenly with Willpower and keep the consistanly rising as much as possible because one day u will mainly be a caster.
<LI>Willpower = follow same guide lines as intellect here
<LI>Charm = Charm is luck dont have under 50 thats bad luck .. have 50 minimum and raise it when you don't have much else to raise for additional dodge bonuses.
