| There are as many kinds of Mages as there are other classes: Wizards,     |
| Sorcerors, Necromancers, Summoners, Transmuters, Elementalists, and a     |
| dozen more. Most of these specialists, though, never venture forth from   |
| their respective towers as they are not very well suited to adventuring.  |
| For this reason, most magic-users you meet in cities will be general      |
| Mages. These people are quite powerful, and wield a potent magical        |
| arsenal. Mages have at their command mostly combat and defense spells, as |
| they are either adventurers, searching for fortune, or are the emissaries |
| of other Wizards, who need them to search out lost artifacts or spell     |
| components. Either way, they are formidable and unpredictable foes. Mages |
| use only staves (including the staff-sling) and daggers in combat, as     |
| they need as much mobility as possible. For this reason also, they will   |
| only wear robes for protection, and thus rely on their magic for          |
| protection.                                                               |

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>Races:</B></FONT> Dark-elf, Elf, Halfling, Goblin, Nekojin<P>

<B>Pro's Vs Con's:</B> Well, the pro's are obvious: sneaking and hiding and higher ac from 
higher agility early on. 
The con's are not so obvious: low encumbrance, lower sc if you go with
agil for better stealth early on, no damage bonuses to combat damage.
Personally, I'd be an elf for a sneaker. Halflings get the -to hp which
makes for a lousy time at low levels.  Dark-elves aren't bad, but the 
elves get higher sc overall, and goblins just cost too dang much.

<UL>
<LI>Health =  70 asap, a must for either non-sneakers or sneakers
<LI>Intel = 80 asap, your going to need to survive
<LI>Agility =  get to 70 pretty quick, sacrificing wisdom, charm and strength 
<LI>Strength = 50 is a must
<LI>Charm = +10-20 over base
<LI>Wisdom = +10-20 over base depending on what you want your casting to be
<LI>Intel = 100 asap, trading off health and agility
<LI>Strength = 60 shouldn't need any more unless your're the mule
<LI>Health =  max it
<LI>Agility =  80-90 sacrificing wisdom, charm and strength 
<LI>Charm = 56-70 is fine until you're able to sneak and have good sc and hp's
<LI>Intel = Max it you'll need it
<LI>Wisdom = 80-100 depending on what you want spell casting to be
<LI>Charm = 100 max it if you can

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>Races:</B></FONT> Human, Dwarf, Gnome, Half-elf, Half-Orc, Half-Ogre, Kang, and Guant<P>

<B>Pro's Vs Con's: </B> The pro's are fairly obvious, you get to carry all the eq you want, being
that there's no sacrificing strength for agility.  Depending on the race,
gnomes get the nice picklock bonus, dwarf enc bonues etc.
Personally, if I had to be a non-sneaker, I'd be a <B>gnome</B>. Half-elves just
plain suck if you ask me. Dwarves have nice wisdom and enc, but neither
are of paramount importance to a mage.  Human's make not bad mages 
because of the low exp table. Kang is an ok choice if you want to be a 
poison area scripter and the other halfers are a waste of time until 
they hit a high level. Mana Regen would suffer from the low intel of
some of these races.

<LI>Health = 95 asap, no way to hide or sneak through areas.

<LI>Strength = 65 is not bad for carrying items etc.
<LI>Intel = 100 asap, trading off health
<LI>Charm = 50 is ok until you have decent int/health
<LI>Wisdom = 75 and better to get that extra mag res to take less damage
<LI>from magic based attacks and to get the extra perception and sc.
<LI>Health = 95
