| Clerics are martial Priests. While Priests prefer using spells, Clerics   |
| prefer to fight. And they are quite good at it, too. Like Priests, they   |
| do not enjoy bloodshed (although a little maiming is just fine), and will |
| only use blunt weapons. They will wear any armour in the fight against    |
| their foes, and quite a few wear the most armour they can get. Clerics    |
| are an effective class, and have a strong survival rate due to their good |
| armour an healing spells. They are a valuable addition to any party.      |

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>Races:</B></FONT> <FONT COLOR="#00ffFF">Dark-elf, Elf</FONT>, Halfling, Goblin, Nekojin<P>


<B>Pro's Vs Con's:</B> Now if your thinking of making a sneaking cleric you
moight want to consider a missionary first seeing how they will make much better sneakers
as well as have a bs that is worth while. But if you just have to have
one you are best to choose a delf or gobby for higher wisdom. 

<P><FONT COLOR="#AA00FF">Making a Sneaker (non sneaker)</FONT><BR>
<B>Stat Suggestions (In order of raise)</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Health = get this to 80 first
<LI>Agility = raise it 10-20, should be easy to to adds little stealth and dodge
<LI>Strength = get to 80, hardest stat of sneakers to raise besides health but most important, improves stealth and bs, besides being able to carry more armour
<LI>Wisdom = 60 Helps a priestly spell casting tremendously
<LI>Intel = raise to 50, improves stealth
<LI>Charm = raise to 50, improves stealth and dodge
<LI>Health = get this to 95 next, get lots of hps, Mwhahaha!!!
<LI>Agility = raise to 100, swing more and dodge more, also improve stealth tremendously
<LI>Strength = get to 100, hit harder and carry more armour
<LI>Wisdom = 80 or less after lvl 20 your wisdom isn't that important since you'll be able to fight better than cast gstk on something
<LI>Intel = raise to 100, makes you start crit-ing everwhere and improves stealth
<LI>Charm = raise to 100, improves stealth, and you'll notice you'll get hit much less
<LI>Wisdom = put the lst few lvls of cps here
</UL>

<B>Pro's Vs Con's: </B> Not quite the paladin but more of a priest then
a cleric is right for you. Currently they can get greater healing and divine fury that makes them
equal to a priests attacking power plus they can swing better with their higher combat.
go dwarf for the extra enc and all the armour you can carry.


<P><FONT COLOR="#AA00FF">Making a Tank</FONT><BR>
<B>Stat Suggestions:</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Health to 80 for Hps ]:}
<LI>Strength to 80 carry more and hit hard
<LI>Agility to 80 swing more, and dodge a little
<LI>Wisdom = 60 will help your spell casting
<LI>Intel add 10 start getting more crits
<LI>Charm = 50 start dodgeing more and helps a little of everything
<LI>Health = get this to 95 next, get lots of hps, Mwhahaha!!!
<LI>Agility = raise to 100, swing more and dodge , because it weighs 0, also improve stealth tremendously
<LI>Strength = get to 100, hit harder and carry more armour
<LI>Wisdom = 80 or less after lvl 20 your wisdom isn't that important since you'll be able to fight better than cast gstk on something,
<LI>Intel = raise to 100, makes you start crit-ing everwhere and improves stealth
<LI>Charm = raise to 100 or less, for crits and dodge
