you are in the village of New Haven.&nbsp; This village is the place where

<ol>
<li><font face= verdana, helvetica, arial ><font size=-1>Type "look" and you
will get a description of where you are.  If there are people there
they will be either player characters or non-player characters (NPCs). 
NPCs are characters who are played by the computer as opposed to player
characters, such as your character, which are played by other people.
You may talk to NPC's by typing "greet <character name>" i.e." greet guard". 
Sometimes NPC's may have helpful information so it is a good idea to talk
to them.
<li><p>  Your first stop in the
village is the armor shop.  Type "s" to go south.  Type "look"
to find out what you see in the shop.  Type "list" to see what is
available to buy in the shop.  Buy all of the items which are free. 
You may do this by typing "buy &lt;item>" i.e. "buy padded helm".  
It is important to buy armor.  Armor affects your armor class, which
is how hard it is for monsters to land blows on you when you are in combat. 
The better your armor, the harder you are to hit.  Once you have purchased
your armor, you need to actually wear it to obtain its benefits. 
To do this type "wear &lt;item>" i.e. wear padded helm.
<li><p> At any time you may check
to see what items you are carrying and where they are.  Type "i" to
see that you are wearing your armor.
<li><p> Your next stop should be the
weapons shop.  Type "n" to go north until you reach the weapons shop. 
Use the same procedure that you used in the armor shop to see what is there
and what items are available.  Buy whichever free item you can use. 
Type "wear &lt;weapon>" so that weapon will be in your hand ready to use.
<li><p>Exit the weapons shop
by heading south once. Then head west once.  If you have the ability
to use spells you will want to go to the spell store.   Check
your Mana by typing "st".  Mana is roughly translated to be your life
force energy.  This can be used to cast spells.  This energy
is depleted as you cast spells but you can type "rest" and you will recover
this energy so that you may cast more spells.  If you would like to
buy some spells, head north one.  Use the same procedure in the spell
store that you used in the armor shop to look around and see what items
you can get for free.  Once you have purchased a scroll with a spell
on it you will want to "read &lt;scroll name>" in order to know how to
cast that spell.  Once you learn a spell you can cast it as often
as you wish as long as you have enough Mana.  If you want to cast
a spell type "cast, spell name, target" i.e. "cast magic missile kobold"
<li><p>The adventurers store
is south of the magic store.  If your character doesn't have night
vision, you will want to buy some torches here.  You may type "help
class" to see whether or not you can see in the dark.   To use
a torch in a dark area  simply type "use torch".
<li><p>Move west and type "Look
down".  This is the arena where you will go to fight monsters when
you are ready.
<li><p>Right now, however,
you should move north to the trainer.  Type "exp" and you will see
that as a brand new character you have no experience.  You gain experience
by fighting and killing monsters.  When you have enough experience
you can move up a level by coming to the trainer and typing "train". 
Every time that you move up a level you obtain additional lives( you start
with nine) if you need any, as well as more hit points which help you stay
alive longer in combat.  Hit points are like your physical mana, the
state of your health and the physical strength that you have available. 
You lose hit points in combat and regain them by typing "rest".
<br>     The
only reason that you as a new character need to visit the trainer is if
you haven't already allocated all of your character points which you obtained
when you first generated your character.  You may do this by typing
"train stats".
<li><p>Move south and west
to the healer.  Type "read sign".  If you would like to buy a
healing spell, type "buy &lt;spell name>" i.e. "buy minor healing". 
These spells will give you back your hit points faster than you could regenerate
them by resting.  Always watch your hit points!  If you get down
to zero hit points and you have no friends around to help you,  you
will die!
<li><p>Now that you have had a brief
tour of New Haven, you will want to start fighting some monsters so that
you can gain experience and start to move up in level.  Move back
to the arena.  You may also want to review the combat help file by
typing "help combat".  Before you go down into the arena check to
make sure that you are wearing your armor (not just carrying it), have
your weapon in your hand ready to use, and that you know the spells that
you may want to cast.  You may want to practice your magic, if you
have Mana, by casting a blur spell on yourself before you enter combat. 
This spell will make you harder to hit.  You will also want to try
using the magic missile spell.
<li><p>If you are a class or race
with stealth, you'll want to practice sneaking by typing SN, type it again
if it tells you you don't think you are sneaking.  Once you think
you are sneaking type D for down, and then type BS MONSTERNAME (i.e. bs
kobold).  BS stands for backstab.  If you don't successfully
sneak or backstab, you can always go back up and try again.
<li><p>If you are a mystic,
you have special attacks listed in the help combat screen.  JU MONSTERNAME
(i.e. ju kobold) to jumpkick, or PU MONSTERNAME to punch. 
<li><p>If you are not a class
or race with stealth, and you are not a mystic or magic user, you will
type A MONSTERNAME (i.e. a kobold) to attack. You do not need to type any
adjectives in front of the name of the monster. For example, if you are
attacking an angry giant rat you only need to type A RAT.
<li><p>Go down into the arena. 
A monster will appear for you to fight.  Don't wait for the monster
to attack you!  Go get 'em!  Watch your hit points.  If
you find that you are getting close to zero type "up" to get out of the
arena.  Don't worry if you get killed the first time.  You have
eight more lives and can always create a new character if you want to. 
Once you have killed a monster, you should check your hit points to see
how many you have lost.  If you have only a few hit points left you
might get killed by the next monster which appears, so you will want to
go up out of the arena and rest until you regain your strength.  If
you should be killed by a monster you will start again at the healer with
nothing, and you will need to go back to the various shops to get more
armor, weapons etc.  You will retain knowledge of any spells that
you know before you were killed.
<li><p>Occasionally monsters will
drop money when they are killed.  This money is yours if you can get
it without getting killed by the next monster that appears.  Simply
type "get" followed by the quantity and type of coin, i.e. "get 8 silver". 
This money will come in handy when you want to buy better weapons or spells. 
<li><p>Remember to check your experience
and go to the trainer when you have enough points to go up a level.
<li><p>When you have reached
level 3, you are ready to move on to Silvermere.  Head southwest and
follow that trail until you reach the boatman.  Type BORROW SKIFF
to row across the water to the new city.  Once you have reached the
far dock, type MAP.  This will show you a map of the city you are
now in and where everything is at.  Move south to get to River Street. 
Explore around and start finding new monsters to fight, like in the slums
to the south. Join groups of larger characters to get to places you normally
couldn't and to go on quests.  Most importantly, have a good time!</font></b></td>
