<p>So you just heard about Major MUD and think
you might want to play. This page will give you the info you need
to get started! If you have never played any role-playing games before
and think that this is all WAY too confusing, <a href="howtoplay.html">click
here</a> to learn more about fantasy role-playing games.
<p>When playing a role-playing game, you have to create a character.  In 
MajorMUD, you "become" your character.  So it's important that you create someone
you'll enjoy "being" while in an enormous fantasy world. You will adventure
with this character through a land similar in many ways to Europe
in the Middle Ages, except that this land includes creatures and treasures
from myth and legend. In this land magic really works! Your
only limits are those of your imagination!
<p>You will not need any additional software to play this game.  However, there is software 
available at the <a href="http://www.mudmarket.com/">MUD Market</a> which you MAY use
to increase your enjoyment of the game.
<p>Major MUD requires that you buy time to play. Click <a href="rates.html">here</a> to learn about the different rate structures.

<p>
<ol><li>This first thing you need is a good grasp of the principles
behind the game. There is a great deal of information available about
Major MUD and the more you know, the easier it will be to get started.
This <a href="http://www.majormud.com/" >page</a> will tell
you more about some of the basic concepts of the game. When you are through,
you may close that browser window and return to this page.
<p>
<li>The next thing you need to do is sign up. Simply fill out the
form on this <a href="http://www.greatermud.com/signup.html" >
page</a>.  When you are through, you may close that browser window
and return to this page.
<p>
<li>When you have completed the sign up form, you need to pay for the
time that you want to play.
<p>Click the play button on the <a href="http://www.greatermud.com/" >MUD ARENA page</a>. 
You may use either the Java or Telnet interfaces.
The options you will be chosing from are the same for either choice.
When using the Telnet option you must already have Telnet software on your
computer.  Most computers with Windows 95 or 98 usually have telnet software
already loaded onto them.  If you don't have telnet software on your computer
you might try a search engine to find a place on the internet where you 
can download the software.  The Java interface will work without any additional software.
<p>Once you have made your choice, sign in using the username
and password that you just created. You will see a list of other
players online. Hit the "Enter" key until you get to the end of this
list. Hit the "Enter" key again to get to the main menu. At
this time, the only option that will work for you is "h" , "How to purchase
more time". Hit "Enter" again, then type "h" and hit "Enter" to get
into the payment screen. Type "c" and hit "Enter" to get to the credit
card payment screen and follow the instructions or type "m" and hit "Enter"
to get more info on other methods of payment.
<p>
<li>Now that you have paid for your time, go back to the main menu.
At this time there are seven MUD games for you to chose from. This
<a href="whichMUD.html" >page</a>
will help you decide which game is for you. You may create one character
in each of these seven MUDs if you so chose, however, you may only have
one character at a time in each MUD. On the main menu, there is also
another game called <a href="http://www.rosecog.com/" >"The
Rose"</a> which is similar to Major MUD. When you first enter any
of the MUDs, a menu will come up. Going into the help menu would
be a good idea to familiarize yourself with some of the rules of this particular
MUD. Once you have printed out any information that you would like
easy access to, you are ready to create your character.
<p>
<li>The first time you enter a MUD, you will be asked to create a character.
You will want to have already read the information about creating a character
on these <a href="http://www.mudcentral.net/chardev/index.html" >
pages</a>, so you will be able to create the kind of character that you
want.
<p>You will be asked for the race of your character.  For additional information
about the different races, <a href="MUDRaces.html">click here</a>.  Next you will be 
aked to chooose the class of your character, then whether you want to be lawful or not. Then you will
be asked to create the attributes of this character. If you haven't
already, go to this <a href="http://www.mudcentral.net/chardev/index.html" >page</a> 
and click on the class of the character that you are creating. This will
help you in picking the best attributes for your character. When
you have returned to the Java or Telnet screen, you start at the attributes
page. The cursor will be next to your user name. Type in the first
name you want for your character and hit "Enter". You will be asked
for a family name. Just make one up to go with your character's first name.
Hit "Enter". You will be told: You have 100 CP to distribute.
<p>Then you will be shown the strength category with a number 
next to it. You can raise this score or let it stand as you see fit.
All of your attributes start out at a base which varies according to the 
race of your character, and you can distribute extra
points to the attributes that you want to be the highest. Once you
have created your attributes, you are asked for a few physical characteristics.
<p>Next you are told to create a suicide password.
You do this by typing "set suicide".
<p>The suicide password will prevent you from accidently committing suicide.
Your character starts with nine lives. If you don't like the attributes
of your character or would like to create a new character for whatever
reason, you may type "suicide now". This will erase your current
character and you may make a new one from scratch. If you get caught
in a situation that you can't get out of ,and would like to start playing
in another location, you can type "suicide". This will use one of
your lives and place your character back with the healer.
<p>
<li>Now you are actually playing the game. You start out in a place
called <a href="NewHaven.html">New Haven</a> which is a separate section
of the game geared toward helping new players learn the ropes. Typing
a "?" or "help" will get you to the help menu when you are unsure of your
next move. Other helpful commands are: "look", which describes what
you see in the area around you and "i", for inventory, which describes
the items you are carrying.
