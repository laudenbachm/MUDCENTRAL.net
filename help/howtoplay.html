<p>With all the information out there about MajorMUD, it's ok to be confused! Hopefully though, with a little playing experience and after reading the introduction you will have a better understanding of the game.
<p> MajorMUD is a fantasy role-playing game.
This means that you create a character who you will take adventuring through
a medieval fantasy land. Your character will meet other characters,
fight monsters, and hunt for treasure. Maybe you'll even use magic!
<p> Let's start out with what MUD means.
MUD stands for multi-user dungeon. In other words a place where you can
adventure with other characters.
<p> What's a character you ask? A character
is, well, you! Or at least your alter ego in the game. When
you first enter MajorMUD, you will be asked to create your character.
The first thing that you will need to choose
is the race of your character. Each of the races has different abilities and characteristics along with advantages and disadvantages. For example, Elves are a physically slim race
with a great deal of magical ability. If you want your character
to use magic then you might want him or her to be an Elf as they are well-suited
to using magic. However, an Elf might not be such a good choice if
you want your character to get into a lot of hand-to-hand combat.
In that case, you might want to have your character be a member of a race
which is physically stronger. Read about the characteristics of the
different races <a href="MUDRaces.html">here</a>.
<p> In the real world, everyone has a job, even
if your job is just being a slacker! It's the same in MajorMUD, it's
just that your job is adventuring. What kind of adventurer do you
want to be? Would you like to be able to use magic to fight monsters
and get ahead in this fantasy world? Or would you like to be able
to sneak around and get what you want through thievery without putting
yourself at risk of losing life and limb like those other adventurers?
Perhaps you'd like to do both.
<p> This is where class comes in. Your class is
like your job. You can be a Mage who specializes in spell casting
or a powerful Warrior whose physical strength and agility are his forte.
You could even be a Warlock who has both combat abilities and magicial
skills. There are many other options so read the information on classes
<a href="http://www.mudcentral.net/chardev/index.html">here</a>, keeping in mind that some of the races are suited to certain classes.
<p> Now that you know about race and class, you
need to learn about attributes. Attributes are personal characteristics.
This is where you get to choose how strong your character is, how smart,
how agile, etc. When allocating your attributes keep in mind the
class of your character and how you want him or her to operate in the game.
For example, if you want your character to use magic, you will want
to make sure that he or she has a high level of intelligence to be able
to cast spells better. However, this characer won't really need a
lot of strength as he or she won't be wielding a weapon all that often.
There are some recommendations about allocating your attributes on the
<a href="http://www.mudcentral.net/chardev/index.html"> character development</a> page.
<p>During the character creation process you will be able to make some
choices about how your character appears. These are just to make
your character more real to you but won't have any bearing on his or her
ability to be a viable character.
<p> Now that you have created your character, you
will want to start adventuring. The area in which you find yourself
is similar to medieval Europe. There are many small villages
on this world. The people are simple by today's standards.
They have simple professions. Some of the first people you will meet
in this new world are shop keepers. Most of the people are unremarkable
peasants, farmers, and townspeople. You're one of the exceptions.
There is nothing wrong with being one of the countless townspeople except
that you find it incredibly boring! You are an adventurer. You crave
excitement and the thrill of victory. You want to succeed!
As an adventurer you do this by adventuring. You want to
gain experience so that you can become more powerful and move up in the
world. Adventurers are classified in many ways, one of which is level.
You always want to get more experience so that you can move up in level.
In the real world, it's like getting a promotion. You work hard at
something and learn it well so you eventually get a promotion where you
make more money and get more responsibility and more control over your
situation.
<p> Since you don't really know much about adventuring
at this point, we have constructed a special village called <a href="NewHaven.html">Newhaven</a>, which is where you can learn the mechanics of playing the game.
There are different MajorMUDs which you can access. Click <a href="whichMUD.html">here</a>
to learn which one is the best choice for you. This <a href="index.html">link
</a>will guide you through a step-by-step process to get started playing the game.
