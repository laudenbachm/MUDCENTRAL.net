<br>The origins of humanity are shrouded
in obscurity. This may seem a ludicrous statement, but the fact is there
-- humans just mysteriously appeared one day. Theories on this event are
numerous. Some say the Elves found humanity's ancestors roaming in the
woods, and nurtured them over the ages until they were mature enough to
survive as a sentient species. Another hypothesis is that humans are from
a distant star, and that one day a great sky-craft collided with this land
and created the barren wasteland to the east. Whatever the solution is,
the Elves will not, or cannot say. In any case humans have flourished in
the past four hundred years, and now their domain is such that they are
the most numerous people in the realm. Human males average just under six
feet tall, and females about five and a half. They have no extra
special abilities or aptitudes save for their versatility and drive.
They do equally well in any class, but are nicely suited for the Ranger
and Druid classes, which require well developed statistics all around.</font></b></td>

<br>DWARVES
<br>EXP: +30%
<br>Dwarves are the second oldest
race known today. The Elves, of course, are the first. Dwarves average
about four and a half feet in height, and tip the scales at around two
hundred pounds each. They are a solitary folk, and do not easily welcome
strange people -- but do not mistake this for hostility. Once you have
gained a Dwarf's friendship, that bond will last to the death (or betrayal).
They are cautious and slow to anger, but once their wrath is roused they
are terrible enemies. Dwarves love and craft precious gems and metals of
all sorts, and are great worksmiths. They manufacture worthy and elaborate
suits of mail, and craft gleaming axes with blades of true-silver. These
items seldom leave the underground homes of the Dwarves, but there
are stories of heroes who have done some great service and have received
such a Night Vision gift. Dwarves make excellent Clerics,
Paladins and Warriors. Their stubborn nature and strong willpower give
them good defense against magic. Overall, Dwarves are a resilient folk
who should not lightly be trifled with.</font></b></td>

<br>GNOMES
<br>EXP: +20%
<br>Gnomes are distant cousins of
the Dwarves. They are about the same height as Dwarves, but are considerably
slimmer. Long ago a tribe of Dwarves made its home on the surface, far
from the ancient homeland. Over the centuries this tribe changed,
becoming less dependent on their muscles and more on their wits. As this
progressed, the natural technological ability of the Dwarves was changed
into something more refined than metallurgy or mining: machinery. Where
an Elf sees a waterfall and reflects on its natural beauty, and a Dwarf
sees only the precious stones being smoothed in its waters, a Gnome plots
water-wheels and dams. Gnomes are cunning and inventive, always thinking
up new plots and trying to devise more and more efficient ways to do things.
They make proficient Mages and Thieves, because they have natural cunning
and curiosity. Gnomes can see well in the dark due to their Dwarven ancestry,
as well as having an inborn facility with locks and a slightly increased
resistance to hostile magics.</font></b></td>

<br>HALFLINGS
<br>EXP: +25%
<br>Little is known about this shy,
reclusive folk. Physically, they average around three feet high, about
half the height of a human (hence the name) and are therefore quite weak.
They are surprisingly tough and incredibly agile -- halfling quickness
is deceptive, and some adventurers get more than they bargain for when
they tangle with a Halfling. They are fond of good company and good
drink, and are very soft-hearted overall. But when a Halfling is cornered,
or his home (or food and drink!) is threatened, they will fight with a
ferocity that would startle any but the most seasoned of adventurers. Halflings
do not take too well to magic, and seldom is a Hafling seen who can
demonstrate magical powers of any sort. Show a Halfling a good beer, a
comfortable seat, and pleasant company, and you will have a friend for
life! They make incredible Thieves, due to their innate agility and stealth.</font></b></td>

<br>ELVES
<br>EXP: +45%
<br>Elves are the Elder race. They
are as old as the trees and the rivers they love so dearly. Ever since
time has been recorded, the Elves have been there, singing and tending
to the forest animals. Nowadays the Elves are few in number, their
folk slowly dwindling as the groves they live in are hewn down. They do
not begrudge this, though, but see it as the passing of an age, the time
of Humans. The Elves seen in cities are the very young, high-spirited and
short on experience. They seem almost like children -- excitable and inquisitive,
even though some of them may be older than entire human lineages.
Physically, Elves are quite tall, the same height as humans, but seem much
taller due to their slimness. They are extremely magical creatures, and
many are pacifistic -- unless there is some cause for action. In that case,
they make savage fighters, both with spell and sword. Elves make
great Mages, Warlocks and Gypsies, due to their quick wits and grace.
They can see well in the dark, and have increased power in spellcasting
professions.</font></b></td>

<br>HALF-ELVES
<br>EXP: +15%
<br>Half-Elves are the offspring
of a Human and an Elf. Most are born from Human raids into Elven lands
-- Humans can sometimes be despicable -- but some are the result of an
Elf and Human partnership. This is a rare occasion, for though Elves are
very beautiful to Humans, they are aloof,
and rarely mix with others. This
dubious background makes many Half-Elves bitter and so they remain loners,
not wanting to be part of any culture (and in their minds, not welcome).
These are usually ferocious and un-trusting, but make good allies if you
can gain their respect. They look much like humans, except they are slimmer
and more attractive, with slightly Elven features. They mix the good qualities
of both races, and are quite versatile. Half-Elves have the same increased
magical power as their Elven cousins, and often choose the path of the
Ranger or Druid, due to their preference for solitude.</font></b></td>

<br>DARK-ELVES
<br>EXP: +45%
<br>Dark-Elves are not actually a
seperate race, but are in fact a fanatic sect of Elves who believe that
the other races of the realm are destroying the ancient homelands
of the Elves, and must be stopped for this. They are the enemy of
all other races (save Elves), and will wage war with anyone who threatens
the forests and their homes. Dark-Elves do not accept the traditional Elven
belief that this is the natual course of time, and are determined to stop
it. Consequently, they are driven from any already- populated area, and
so make their homes far from the wooded groves they love. Most live
in the mountains, or in caves, and thus have a much more pallid complexion
than their sylvan brethren. Due to their harsher lives they are tougher
and less friendly between themselves. Any Dark-Elf seen outside of a stronghold
is one who does not agree with the intolerant views of his people -- an
outcast. Dark-Elves are more skilled in combat than the Elves, but
are less powerful magically, making them ideally suited to be Warlocks,
Gypsies or Ninjas.</font></b></td>

<br>HALF-ORCS
<br>EXP: +0%
<br>Half-Orcs are almost exclusively
the result of an Orc raid on a Human village. They are not terrible-looking,
having only the squinty eyes, pronounced canines and coarse hair of an
orc, but the innate Orcish poor temper is passed on to these offspring.
They are much better behaved than Orcs, and do not have the homicidal hatred
for the other races that Orcs do (unless they have been raised by Orcs,
and then you will see them only as your foes). They are somewhat dull-witted,
and are not terribly patient but they are tough as nails and are relentless
in battle. Having a trustworthy Half-Orc companion is like having your
own personal army. They excel in all things martial, especially in
the Witchunter class, where their instinctive fear of magic can be
used to advantage. Half-Orcs are almost universally mistrusted, which is
quite unfortunate since they are not horrible by nature, and so must
continually prove their worth. Many Half-Orcs seek mercenary service, where
no questions are asked and where their strength is in demand.</font></b></td>

<br>GOBLINS
<br>EXP: +35%
<br>Goblins have a decidedly mixed
reputation. First off, they average about five feet tall, have pale green
or grey skin, and save for the fine, luxuriant hair on their heads they
have little or no body hair. They are almost always smiling, in that white,
sharp-toothed grin of theirs, and more often than not you cannot tell whether
or not they are eyeing you like a side of meat. Despite their unsettling
near-savagery they have a disarming charm which almost offsets their strange
appearance. Almost. Goblins are thin and wiry, small and compact but very
tough for their size. They are extremely intelligent, and are exceedingly
agile -- they are well-suited for any Mage or Thief class, though are in
their element in the Gypsy class. Goblins are fond of bartering,
and will sit for hours to haggle down the price of a loaf of bread
by one copper coin. Many wealthy merchants hire a Goblin to deal
with others of his kind, and the sight of two goblins in a haggling
contest is a sight to see! They are stealthy, and have night vision.</font></b></td>

<br>GAUNT ONES

<br>Also known simply as 'Gaunts',
this mysterious and reclusive folk are by far the least fathomable of the
known races. Physically, they are immediately recognizable-- they
stand seven feet tall on average, but are incredibly thin. They have long
limbs and an elongated face, with large eyes that radiate a pale glow.
Gaunts dwell in the most remote areas of the realm, and rarely mix with
other folk. When they do, it is most often to hire someone to obtain rare
materials, which (it is rumored) they use for highly magical purposes.
As a race they are incredibly brilliant, with a masterful grasp of all
things arcane and forgotten. They are also quite devious, and show little
emotion -- a combination which makes folk fearful and suspicious of their
motives.Outsiders never see their concealed homes. Gaunts' eyes are extremely
magical, allowing them perfect vision in total darkness, as well as a heightened
perception. Rumours abound about a secret ritual that allows them,
after attaining a certain level *read text of power, to see hidden people.</font></b></td>

<br>Half-Ogres are the offspring
of an Orc and an Ogre. No-one really knows, or wants to know how
this comes about. They are about seven feet tall, and are quite hairless.
Their bodies are nearly all muscle, and their strength is unmatched for
creatures their size. Unfortunately, they have all the cunning and tact
of a six-year-old-human, and the coordination of a drunk. Half-Ogres
have a rash temper, but are easily distracted, and so if you are careful
it is possible to avoid conflict with one. Many store- owners
have Half-Ogre workers, for they can work tirelessly and can lift hundred-pound
barrels with ease. They have neither the near-berserk fury of Ogres, nor
the animal intelligence of Orcs, but have a simple kind of personality
which is almost pitiable. They are not truly evil, but are frequently
exploited due to their stupidity. Half-Ogres are almost exclusively
Warriors. Due to their lack of focus, they cannot learn Kai
skills and powers, and all of them are quite resistant to hostile
magic. A powerful, but extremely slow race.</font></b></td>

<br>Imagine a cross between a snake
and a lizard, standing on two feet like human and with predatory intelligence,
and what you have is the Kang. They are a mysterious folk that live in
the depths of secluded swamps and jungles, and are rarely seen in mannish
cities. When they do venture forth it is to see the odd splendour of the
outside world, and so the specimens encountered outside of their
homes are usually more intelligent and friendly than their exotic
swamp relatives. Kang are tall, many nearing seven feet in height,
and are broadly muscled. Their scaly skin is much thicker than human skin,
and is a different colour for each tribe. They have a strange loping walk,
and are not very flexible, which is odd since they are snake-like. Kang
apparently worship a deity of Peace and Healing, and many of them are Paladins,
on some personal crusade to extinguish all evil in the land. They
are fierce fighters, and excel as Clerics, Warriors and Witchunters.
Kang are apparently immune to, or at least resistant to, all known poisons.</font></b></td>

hail from the far east, past the Dwarven stronghold of Khazarad, where
the burning desert wastes lay. They are a cat-like race, with long tufted
ears and large oval eyes that glitter with a predatory intelligence.
Nekojin stand about five feet tall on average, but weigh only slightly
more than half a human's weight. Blindingly quick, they have a natural
charm and speed that often over- whelms all who meet them. Though they
are not well-suited for scholarly pursuits, they are natural stalkers and
excel in any stealthy profession. Hailing from the desert, they resist
sheat and fire, but are vulnerable to cold attacks. Nekojin are ferocious,
proud, extravagant, and extremely competitive. They love to show
off and are quite friendly when the mood suits them. All Nekojin
are very stealthy, can see well in the dark, and have a natural tracking
ability.</font></b></td>
