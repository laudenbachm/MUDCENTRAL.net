;This is a somewhat crude exp/hour and other things calculator.
;It can give you an idea of how to incorporate read-outs into
;other scripts, though.
;The number of lines of code could be reduced a lot, probably.
;But I'm a lazy man that doesn't want to bother.
;If your statline changes, change this:
statline = "[HP=" ; It only needs something that never changes
                  ; in it. (HP= would never change.
