<pre>This text relates to MajorMUD v1.1d and all other versions

consistent with it in their experience tables.



Notation:

1) a string of numbers delimited by underscores means

   that that string is infinitely repeated,

   eg, 1/3 = 0._3_ and 4/3 = 1._3_ and 1/7 = 0._142857_

2) the function floor() simply rounds down towards negative

   infinity the real number within the parentheses into an integer



Note that the multipliers from second level are only

approximate.  They are not calculated from the other type of

multiplier.  They are calculated simply by dividing the current

experience by the base experience at level two.  For the most

part, I chose to keep only 4 significant digits.  The second

type of multipliers are inherently approximate because at each

new level, the experience is always rounded down to an integer,

so that for different race/class combinations, the rounding

will take place at different levels.



If you want to figure out the experience table for any

race/class combination *exactly*, you'll have to start with the

base experience and calculate it one by one, each level from

the last, using the first type of multiplier.  If you just

want an approximate value for one particular level for some

race/class, you can just use the second type of multiplier.

Also, you can approximate for a fixed level the experience

needed for one class using another class's value.  For instance,

a dark-elf ranger needs 8,062,050 for lvl 20 with base exp 280.

A dwarf paladin would need very close to 245/280 of this.



For levels 2 to about 43 million exp:

Experience for nth level is calculated with multiplers from

experience needed for (n-1)th level, rounded DOWN.

ie, new_exp = floor(old_exp * multiplier for new_level)



Without special measures, integer variables can only go so high.

In MajorMUD's calculations of experience, special measures are

taken once the numbers are predicted to be too large.  This

limit is called the maximum size of an unsigned long integer

(4 bytes).  An unsigned long integer has a range from 0 to

(2^32)-1 = 4,294,967,295.  Now, the multipliers to calculate

experience from one level to the next are stored as fractions

with integral parts.  Suppose we are going from level 26 to 27;

then the fraction is 99/79.  The exp needed for lvl 26 is first

multiplied by 99, and then checked to see if it surpassed

(2^32)-1.  If it hasn't, the new product is then divided by 79

to get the exp needed for lvl 27.  Otherwise, a new procedure

is used to work within the confines of unsigned long integers.

What happens then is that all the experience needed from there

on become multiples of 100, so MajorMUD can ignore the last two

digits, effectively increasing by 100 the numbers it can work

with (at the price of not being able to work directly with the

last two digits).  If you understood all this, you need no

explanation of the following formula:



new_exp = 100 * floor(floor(old_exp/100) * 115 / 100)



(Nit-picky question: why not *1.15, rather than *115/100 ?

Because programs and computers in general can become rather

inaccurate when dealing with real numbers.  Careful operations

with integers are safer.)

======================================================================



A human thief (80) needs about 333 million for level 50.

A goblin ranger/mystic with about the same exp would be about

   (log(290/80)/log(1.15)) = 9 lvls lower, lvl 41.

A goblin ranger/mystic (290) needs about 1.21 billion for level 50,

   about 290/80 = 3.63 times that needed by a human thief.

And for all you countless dwarf paladins, you need just over

   one billion, which will match you with a lvl 49 dark-elf ranger...



By such high levels, the difference is excruciating.  But the more

subtle and more excruciating difference comes when you look not

at the total amount of experience needed for a certain level,

but at the amount you need to gain to rise to the next level.  Another

point of view, more comforting for classes with more costly experience

tables, comes when you stop comparing the experience needed for a given

level, and look at the levels obtained with a given amount of

experience.  A thief may always need several times less exp than others

(focusing on the multiplicative aspect), but will only be several levels

ahead for a given amount of experience (focusing on the additive

aspect), and at the cost of, well, being a thief...
